Jun: Income $4760, Savings (Emergency Fund) $250 5%, Retirement $290 6%, Expenses $5085 107%
7/24: Income $4954, Savings(Emergency Fund) $250 5%, Retirement $305 6%, Expenses $4355 88%
Extra income	$50.00 (employer covering cell)
Private school	$0.00 (was $750 per month, gone as of June 2017, oldest daughter switching to free public school next month)
Childcare/Camps	$400.00 (400 avg per month. ~$2k in summer for oldest daughter. ~6k for youngest daughter daycare/VPK. I cover 60%)
Utilities	AT&amp;T; Wireless	91.86 (this goes down to about $57-60 next month)
Places without strict zoning in the states are pretty rare (Houston being one of the notable examples), I'd be pretty shocked if zaurg's neighborhood didn't mandate detached SFHs on large lots like so many residential neighborhoods do.
250k balance, 30-year fixed @ 4.5%, $1750 monthly payments, which includes a good chunk of that going to escrow to cover Homeowners Insurance (around annual $2600) and Property Tax (around annual $2800).
229 Gifts - Gave 200 to family (not normal, can't recall the last time I did that) plus Mother's Day gift.
Nah my point was just that zoning likely means that the residential area you're in is legally barred from having smaller (and thus cheaper) homes. This is very common in the states, part of the purpose of zoning is to exclude those poorer than yourself from the neighborhood.
Yeah your misc expenses actually look pretty reasonable, sure you could cut down a bit (especially on 'one-offs' that I'm guessing are not so infrequent), but really it's the housing that's killing you. If you were single and childless I might suggest getting a roommate, maybe even more than one, but I dunno how well that kind of thing would work when you're divorced and sharing custody.
25 Housing/Pool Supplies (170 total spent so far from January to July on "House/Pool Supplies", or about 25 per month. This seems low/lucky. I don't think 25/month is going to be the norm for an average year. I haven't done any repairs or upgrades this year, nothing has broken or need to be replaced yet. So I'm not sure what the true monthly amount over the course of a year in a multi-year span is.)
150 Water (every 2 months)
   
   
 
Total Activity Since Last Statement (Closing Oct. 19, 2017)
(don't actually buy this you idiot zaurg)
$1297 current monthly payment (principal and interest) 
Got this budget thing to $1223 left over. I can switch child2 to part-time aftercare ($120/month) which is 2-4PM, instead of the full-time aftercare 2-6PM ($240/month). Only need it one day a week at most and that day my employer will allow me to pickup @ 4 and bring her to work with me. 
Costco Cash Rewards Balance (Year to Date) $ 193.00
If you break up that G into what you are going to use it for, you can start looking at what (if anything) derails you.
Am I the only one that noticed the 1250 emergency fund number? If you have an emergency you're hosed - get that fixed before anything (including putting extra on your loans). Literally, if your car breaks down or you lose your job/get sick you're absolutely hosed and it won't matter if you paid extra on your loan.
1) I want the comfort and security of having 3 months worth of 100% of my expenses stored away in an emergency fund.
2) I want to have regular savings built up to have the ability to take my kids on a nice vacation once per year, and to have other little vacations with them once in a while, go do fun stuff, sometimes free, sometimes expensive. Just have that capability without using a credit card and without draining any little savings I have.
3) I'd like to have some car security like to be able to budget/save enough to afford to buy a decent car. I'm still driving a 2002 beater and I don't know how much life it has left. 
Yeah, I've been following along for a while, it's kind of surreal that it's been 8 years of mostly the same stuff, but tbh, I bet if we went into E/N we would find gooners in worse shape (fiscal and physical). 
Lawn service	$0.00	(cancelled??? maybe???)
You don't get the candle joke. Your wife sucked at buying stuff, sure. You also blew money you didn't have on things you didn't need. You continue to do so. Eventually you're going to have to make some large changes (the candles) instead of small ones ($2.50 on a cell phone plan).
   
   
 
Edit: Please ignore the post above me. Like, don't even read it. It's bad for you. (Sorry InfrastructureWeek, it's a perfectly good post, just not for zaurg.)
1) Child1 - Christmas - Running Watch/Activity Tracker. I think she would really like this. We talked about it a month ago. I just need something very basic for her and that will fit her small wrist. I'm seeing this for sale on Amazon for $70 so that might do. Garmin is good. 
2) Child2 - Christmas - Bike. I already started looking and I see tons of bikes on craigslist/offerup for $50 and under.
3) Christmas Tree. Tradition. Take the kids and buy a real tree. Will get a small one for $30.
4) Stuffed stockings. Tradition, fun to do. Maybe $30.
5) Child2 - Birthday. Going to ask my dad if he still has his hook-up for pony rides. $0. Invite friends over. Ride ponies for an hour. Get a cake $20. Open presents from other people. He did it a year or two ago and horses are my daughter's favorite thing in the world. Ex can handle getting "goodie bags" for the invited friends. I don't do that nonsense.
6) Secret Santa thing my mom's side of family started doing two years ago. Works much better than having everyone buy gifts for 8 drat kids which is insane. $25 limit.
big container of blackberries, $2.99 (fruit usually sucks at Costco. these aren't bad.)
No lawn cost (80), no restaurant (83,25,91,49,90,15) - thats $308 - I'm not sure where these figures are from (I grabbed them from ) but you get the idea
- Restaurant expense averaged $260 over the past 3 months (Aug $163 + Sep $248 + Oct $369 = 780 / 3 = $260). 
Get in on a family plan with Goons. $2.50/mo ($30/yr up front)
I got the Spotify app (free account) and will try that out again. I think I tried it a couple years ago, already had a login.
1) Electric pool heater
2) 110,000 BTUs
3) Pool size is 9,000 gallons
4) Cost per kWh ranges between $0.09086 to $0.11086 per kWh depending how much I use. Let's just call it $0.10000.

...You guys are really hammering away on this pool heater in Florida luxury. (the lawn expense is gone)

Depending on the various features your pool has, you could save a chunk of electricity cost by managing the pump a little better. Variable speed pumps are much more efficient at low speeds than high speeds, so if you don't have a reason to run the pump at high RPM (rooftop solar, floor cleaner etc) you should run it for longer at a lower speed. 
SAVINGS: $525/month (rent if I got the $1350/mo apartment... $400 saved, electric $50 saved, water $75 saved)
It pains me to think if my ex would've bought-in to my "go debt free" plan back in 2010 or whenever it was (it's in an old thread), I'd have had my old condo mortgage paid off completely and her student loan paid off completely and be completely debt free as of something like 2013/2014. Then ~3 years since then with no mortgage/no debt just banking cash every month with dual incomes. 
IIRC Knyteguy tried living in a 1br with 2 adults, 2 cats and 3 dogs (or maybe 3 cats and 2 dogs, can't remember). No poo poo that was miserable. Zaurg's household, by contrast, consists of 1 adult and no pets all the time, and 2 kids some of the time. Plus we're talking about a 2br not a 1br.
   
   

Personal anecdote- I lived with my two kids in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment for 6 months after my divorce. Shared custody (50/50). My kids were both in the 12-8 yo range. poo poo sucked when they were there, but a mansion when they weren’t. I’d say think long and hard about how the kids interact, if they need personal space, and what milestones come up during your lease. Sometimes kids just want space from each other and if they don’t get it, it becomes a bigger problem. Spending $1,689 34% ($1312 prior to 10/15, $377 after 10/15)
- Move $175 from 10/31 paycheck into Savings (goes towards Dec Water bill and Feb Auto Insurance bill)
Also, 10/15-10/30 we just picked an arbitrary number (250, 350, whatever) that didn't have much meaning to an actual budget so I didn't give that exact number much value to be honest.
1) I need an oil change. "Change Oil Soon" light is on and has been on for a few days.
2) I have a coolant leak somewhere. The "Low Coolant Level" warning light comes on every couple weeks. I refill the coolant tank and the light goes off. Repeat every couple weeks.
3) "Service Engine Soon" light has come on steady at various times over the past couple months, but I haven't seen it on for the past few days.
4) High pitch whistling noise when accelerating
5) Increasing front end vibration lately, not sure where exactly it's coming from.
6) Over the past few months the car just sounds like it runs "rougher", new noises, etc. Perhaps fixing the above issues is the fix and this is just a symptom of the above problems. 
7) Passenger door check strap (aka door check link, aka dentent rod) broke months ago. So the door swings wildly open then won't stay open by itself.
8) Power door locks "Unlock" and "Lock" switches don't work. I have to use the lock control on each door to lock/unlock the doors individually. These were fixed in 2015 then stopped working again. Also it does weird things like when both doors are locked and I unlock the trunk, the driver side door is unlocked.

Thanks. Many things to consider. That's the attitude I had ~17 years ago when my shiny new (used) Nissan Altima was totaled in accident and the insurance company from the guy who hit me paid off my auto loan (~10k balance remaining) and gave me about $500 towards a new car. I was like thanks but now I'm hosed without a car. Sure they compensated me for the loss of the car but they didn't replace my car or the down payment I'd have to shell out to get a new one.
Then just get through Christmas without bankrupting yourself and see where you are heading into 2018. Maybe you find more cuts, maybe you identify a couple of areas (e.g. groceries) and just focus on getting the most bang for your buck from what you do spend. Take it slow, don't let mistakes push you into just giving up, but hold yourself accountable when you spend money, not just when you tally up the damage.

Thanks Fil5, I submitted the form on 10/27 which is when I first heard about the program and was waiting to see what the next step was. Now I'm checking the site and it says the program is closed. From what I'm reading maybe I was supposed to go to the Broward location last week. I was following advice from someone (not a BFC person!) and they said I didn't have to do that. well poo poo

88 Christmas and Thanksgiving related (gift, tree, food)Spent 792 on all discretionary expenses (Grocery, Gas, Gym, etc.). My goal was to stay under 1000. These are all itemized here:
1) In December I want to update spreadsheet for tracking these like I used to:
2) Keep attacking Credit Card balance until it's 0. Then I can figure out if it's better to save more or pay more towards the 5% personal loan.
3) Keep balance in life. No restaurants, but not extreme spending withholding. Stick to the budget. Keep running. Have fun.
4) Make a good goal post in the BFC 2018 Financial Goals thread.
5) Um... so I broke up with girlfriend in October and that was a good decision $$-wise. When I decide to start dating again, meet someone who has similar goals and doesn't mind good home cooked meals most of the time. I think I'm just not going to date for a while as that is an automatic increase to spending which I really can't afford right now. Nor do I have time for it right now.
Don’t stop doing your $1000 mental tally, but this will spare you from your spreadsheets (and all the lying to yourself you tend to do with them)
Thank you. Good tips. I used Mint tonight to add all my accounts, even an old bit of stock my aunt gave me years ago (10 shares has turned into 17 shares, sweet!) and added my personal loan, which I found the original amoritization schedule and the current personal loan balance is $5613.
sidenote; Each year I struggle taking enough PTO at work so that I don't lose it (only 40 hours carries over)! I still have 70 hrs balance even after scheduling the last week of Dec off. Anyone else have this problem? Goal for 2018: Schedule a week or two off in the summer and do fun local stuff with the kids instead of paying to put them in Summer camp.

It's a bad idea to put my normal monthly emergency fund money ($250) into bitcoin right? It went down a lot today. Four times this week at work four coworkers randomly started a conversation about bitcoin with me out of the blue (3 pro, 1 con).

Option 1)
- Student Loan balance would be 0 on June 1st, 2013 (+1 year, 3 months)
- Mortgage balance would be 0 on April 1st, 2016 (+2 years, 10 months)
- if child in free (public or the university) school, we'd have $3358 left over after expenses every month, so we could save up 40k per year. 
- "disaster plan" budget if husband (higher income) lost job would equal about : income 4753, expenses 4239, so 514 left for savings.
Result: Debt free in 4 years 1 month (APRIL 2016), while utilizing the $17k in savings to maintain irregular expenses/emergency fund. Comfortable budget after buying new home. Comfort knowing we could survive on 1 main income.
I won +$15 on fantasy football this year (spent $150, won $165). I received a $50 gift from family. 
Let's say I wanted to blow the $65 by putting it on black (random shitcoin). How would I do that right now?

Nov17 - 792 (Grocery 403, Entertainment 123, Car 79, Gym 21, CC Interest/Fees 58, Misc 108)

Dwight I hear you on all points. Maybe running is enough emotional gratification, I don't know. Got a race at end of month so that's fun (if you can call 26.2 fun).
 it is that you then talk about it to people and in your social media etc - whether you liked it or hated it - 'cos frankly word of mouth is what I have for marketing)
it's like the cost of a pint in a London pub, so if you try before you buy then buy it I'm happy too (and will drink your money), I now do a blog about this guff too (and have businesspeople pay me £££ an hour to tell them blockchains are poo poo, which is pretty sweet while money is raining from the skies)
   
   
 
Keep it up Z, I think I've posted in every one of your threads. I'll be honest that I kinda miss the Schadenfreude of your old threads. For that matter, I wonder where Murderknobs, SloMo, KG, and the froofy sandwiches lady got off to. (Isn't KG known as modest mouse cover band now?).
heh actually in 2008 (or was it 2007?) my thought was to sell my condo for about 200k.
Please let this be the final resolution to this old rear end car's electrical problems. 3x during the past month going out to my car to have the battery be dead is not fun (battery tested fine after getting a jump). Same problem 9 months ago and another auto shop sold me a drat new battery when I knew this crap was the broken door locks. Difference this time is I trust these guys, they are good. I didn't even tell them about the door locks and they properly isolated the problem (hopefully) and fixed it.
I spoke with daughter and reiterated why she's bringing lunch every day (well I didn't really say I have budgeting problems).
This post was from December 22nd. If you had invested $250 into Bitcoin at $15,500 which is worth $9,300 right now. You would have lost %40 and it would be worth $150 right now. Don't forget to pay for transaction fees (probably wiping out half of your remaining value).
I put $3113 USD into cryptocurrency gambling, all via credit card. I started with $250 and originally planned on just doing $250 a month over the course of 4 months for a total of a $1k gamble, but it fairly quickly turned into $3113. At one point I was up (on paper) a good %. This morning during the lowest point I dipped into the negatives.
card1 - $2700 @ 0.99% (for next 9 months, then changes to 13.49%. This was the balance transfer from card2)
Andy - You're probably just looking at Bitcoin. I'm in a bunch of other shitcoins. Continue hodling... well, what is the other option? Cash out now and about breakeven after fees (except what about taxes, if I cash out $3113 USD, do I owe taxes?).
).
   
   
 
That's now how I read it. He dumped $3100 into some sorts of options bets. He is now down to $0 and if he doesn't 'sell' now he can lose even more than his initial $3100 bet (investment is the wrong term here).
The fact that you’re showing us one small transaction that conveniently shows you to be ahead on your investment (at the moment, anyway) makes me suspect that this is the 
card1 - $2700 @ 0.99% (for next 9 months, then changes to 13.49%. This was the balance transfer from card2)
Also let's add $3133 for 2 months (Dec, Jan) @ 16.49% APR charges and include that. 
So you balanced transferred from card2 to open it up for more bitcoin purchases? Does this mean the bulk of them were after the balance transfer (and why you didn’t listen to advice there?)
While like others I enjoy the drama, I’m in the camp that this thread isn’t doing the accident gawkers any good, nor you. Shut it down until 2019, then give us an update of where you are and you can decide if this is helping you, or your own choices are better (this is your current camp).
Hey zaurg, I absorbed over $5,000 in unexpected bills because I forgot to budget for property taxes and insurance (I pay all at once to save interest and fees). I did it by passing on a $3k toy I’d been eyeing for months that normally costs $5k or more. 
My nine year old and two six year olds LOVE putting as much money as they earn (yes, we give them jobs to make money) into the Bank of Dad as they learned their money can make money they don't have to work for. (Generous 12% interest rate to make the math easy) 
* $3k isn’t much in the big scheme of things for people who aren’t using credit cards to finance their gambling addiction (because they have no money) (because they’re morons who can’t manage their finances even with a bunch of free advice)
TraderStav, the setup you have is a fantastic idea that I’m going to crib when my kids are old enough for allowance (oldest is 4). 
   
   
 
Has this happened? (And happened enough that it merits a tracking category?)
Then while drinking my coffee this morning, someone I follow who has been spot-loving-on with this crypto market (followed the predictions for past few months, all accurate) says btc headed back down another 75%.
1) Sell everything now, cash out ~3500 to USD, crypto market goes back up later in 2018 to new ATHs or beyond. Miss out on the gains I originally gambled for.
note: With the cash out I would payoff the highest interest rate credit card2 ($2366), then put the remaining $1134 on card1 to get credit card balances to $2166. There is a good chance my tax refund would take care of that, so it is likely my credit card debt would be gone within a month. 
2) Hodl. Crypto market goes back down 75% or early 2017 levels and stagnates there for a year. Or longer. Leaving me with $3k tied up in that mess. Struggle to knock down credit card balances for the rest of the year. 
then I got more crazy and dove into more unknowns (i guess they're all unknowns but these seemed riskier) like
EMB actually stopped trading for a bit and is no longer on CMC. That's my true shitcoin (1.5 mil shitcoins for $20) it's Trading again on one exchange so I could dump it

ok but will they go to jail after that? the people (at least the ones that are known/in the public) that are behind these projects?
That's it. Like I said on page 21, I originally planned on throwing $1k into it, and should've stuck to that plan (I'd be up &gt; 200% right now if I'd stuck to that!) but I let FOMO get to me and ramped it up to $3113.

FWIW, I liquidated my bitcoins back at the end of december when I realized things were getting insane, and I would have shorted it if there was a decent way to do so (there's not, don't try to do this either). It's only going to get worse from here on out, since without a huge runup in price, casual investors are going to look at the recent drop and shy away from that kind of terrible performance. There's not going to be the influx of idiots who see the huge runup and pour their money in like we had last year. Everyone has heard of bitcoin by now, and people who are going to buy it have bought it. Instead, you're going to have the performance chasers like you who hang on for a few more roller coaster dips and highs and then cash out because you're not making 100% return every month like you wanted. As this happens, the developers will cash out silently and continue lowering the price.

I wasn’t asking for the whole portfolio, I was asking how much is being liquidated (“Option C”). The value more than the specific coins.
Whatever it takes to get credit card balances to zero, around $2k. That would theoretically (it changes a lot every day) leave me with about $1k crypto which is what I originally intended on gambling in the first place.

   
   
 
meanwhile my paychck is automatically divided up into 1) 401k max out, 2) pay all bills automatically, 3) emergency fund till it's fully funded, then switched over to IRA. 401k/IRA filled with low fee index funds. 
Also you know the mindset of these people who get into crypto is loving nuts. Like, 100% gains are meaningless. Everyone wants 100,000% gains. Just chatting with my dad the other day who's last purchase was ETH. I suggested he just hold the ETH instead of throwing it into the garbage shitcoins (ETH is a shitcoin too, I know, I know BFC). His argument was that ETH may only double or even go up 3x, so that's not good. I think this is a fairly common thought process in this land.

Ask me about stealing $3k from my child and gambling it on Bitcoin (Except bold and large and in red)(USER WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THIS POST) (give yourself a way to track progress selling!)
Current value held (rename value to avoid ambiguity) (currently greater than -100% due to interest)
Theoretical remaining ROI (renamed from ROI) structure your running tally to look like money only goes in (this is your brain on hodling).
If you amortize the debts, assuming he doesn't accumulate more debts, he has added a substantial amount of interest. Using an app if he paid $90 per month on $3000 at 17% (rough figures) then that adds $1077 of interest to the cost.
   
   
 
Multiply by 1 plus the interest rate (so 17% is 1.17, 4% is 1.04, 3.5 is 1.035%) - that’s the value after one interest period (a month, a year, etc)
The money in my retirement accounts has more than doubled in ten years. I’ve reduced my expected debt from my mortgage by two thirds. This is how you get rich, through care and discipline. I will almost certainly never have to worry about money for the rest of my life. I can buy whatever dumb poo poo I want (like a forums rereg) because I paid myself and my family first.  -$17,667. This is the present value of a $530 interest payment per year (17% p.a. rate on a $3113 balance) for the rest of your life, at an assumed annual inflation rate of 3% p.a. Note that this is a NEGATIVE NUMBER because you are going to be paying the equivalent of that much because YOU BOUGHT INTERNET FUNNY MONEY WITH A HIGH INTEREST CREDIT CARD.
Expected return = (Probability of Outcome 1 * Possible return from Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 * Possible return from Outcome 2) + (Probability of Outcome 3 * Possible return from Outcome 3)
= (Virtually zero * $infinity) + (Zero * $nil) + (Virtually 100% * -$17,667)) + ($nil) + (very close to the entire -$17,667, like say -$17,510 for nice round numbers)
I know, right? Not everyone is as good at sniffing out scams like we are, Fleta. I looked that teacher in the eye and I just knew she was after the $ she's scraping off the top. I mean let's look at this, I bet they get a deal with Dominos to get large cheese pizza for $6.00 (I used to be a pizza delivery boy, I have experience with this stuff). So, $6.00, and they double cut it, so 16 slices. $0.375 per slice. The kids probably get 2 slices. $0.75 per kid. $3.00 - $0.75 = $2.25 she is banking per kid. GTFO, Teach, my daughter can eat delicious frozen pizza from Trader Joe's ($4.00 pizza, it's actually really good, throw some broccoli on top of it too) with us for dinner once a week and she'll bring her lunch.

Lose: 50% chance, gain of -$100 (or 100% loss, or a net result of zero)
In our coin flip example, the Expected Value of the coinflip is going to be $0 because you have 0.5*$100+0.5*(-$100)
1) You won’t sell at a gain
2) you won’t sell at a break even or slight loss
But we need 100% probability. The first two are near zero, which means there’s an almost guaranteed (100%) chance you hold onto the coins until their value is zero
0.000001*$1,000,000,000 + 0.000001*$3,000 + 0.999998*(-$17,600) means the most likely outcome is that you lose everything. The other outcomes of great wealth are overwhelmed by the vanishingly low probability they will happen.

Zuarg...what's your Bitcoin's value now? Are you rich enough to cash out and pay off a bunch(like, lets say 3113$) of your credit card debt? Sell your bitcoins :zuarg:
1) general mainstream hype - 75%
2) internet nerd hype without pointing at specific coins - 0%
3) specific applications espoused by the coins' own marketing - 25%

visa1) $0 available
visa2) $7,269 available
amex) $6,026 available

Think about how much time you’re spending to make sure you don’t lose your private keys (lol), lose your wallet file (lol), get your passwords hacked at an exchange (lol), none of which prevents the exchange going bust and stealing all your coins (LOL) or the price from cratering leaving you holding the bag. 
This is not an exit price. Why is this not an exit price? Because you have a portfolio of multiple coins. We don't even know the relative weightings of each coin in your portfolio. You do not know which ones (if any) will get to a price that is going to get your portfolio to that number. Even if you did somehow get to that number, you'll just look at your portfolio and go, welp, I got to 6k, why cash out anything at all, I should just keep holding!
   
   
 
Don't even post how much addl crypto you bought (because you know you have did) until you 100x up and then come back to poo poo on all.
The general rule if you're earning a normal-ish amount of money (i.e. not deep into six-figure territory) is that housing shouldn't cost more than 25% of your income, with zaurg being well past that. I went to a financial advisor a very long time ago when I lived in Vancouver and the meeting pretty much derailed immediately because my rent was over 40% of my income and there was basically no way to solve my financial insolvency without fixing that ratio.
Correct. The thing with &gt;25% of your income going into housing generally means even if you're "solvent" on paper, you're probably not putting enough money (if any) into things like savings and retirement, so when something goes wrong financially (like $3113 going on your credit card), you're in trouble.
Pretty sure it's based off net income and includes all direct housing expenses (so rent/mortgage, insurance, HOA fees and property taxes) but doesn't include utilities, it's meant to be a rough guideline. So if you were renting you would ideally want your ceiling to be $1200/month ($10 over the 25% threshold). You can bend it to a certain degree but the more you go over the riskier it gets, and in your case since you're terrible with money you probably want to lean on the 25% as much as possible so your bad decisions aren't as catastrophic.

how much is the deposit for your new place going to be (buy/rent)?
do you really think your daughters will be better off growing up with the risk of being turfed out of a rental agreement every year? (this one is important)
   
   
 set aside a portion for your emergency savings (if that has been drawn down because you had an unexpected emergency expense like your car breaking down) and retirement, Roth IRA, and what you want to put into general savings, etc. pull whatever is left and start sticking it into envelopes. $X for groceries, $Y for gasoline, $Z for eating out, etc. etc. When you run out of money in an envelope, that's it, no more (unless you decide to take it from another envelope).BFC advice not taken (yet?):
1) I want the comfort and security of having 3 months worth of 100% of my expenses stored away in an emergency fund.
2) I want to have regular savings built up to have the ability to take my kids on a nice vacation once per year, and to have other little vacations with them once in a while, go do fun stuff, sometimes free, sometimes expensive. Just have that capability without using a credit card and without draining any little savings I have.
3) I'd like to have some car security like to be able to budget/save enough to afford to buy a decent car. I'm still driving a 2002 beater and I don't know how much life it has left. 
I went back and fixed this. I'd already fixed that poo poo in 2 other places (excel, and the "tracking" sheet on google doc), now it's fixed in the 3rd and final spot.

that's not directly applicable since you have two different properties that are valued differently (your bch is worth 33% more) and so it's not as simple as dividing up your cost basis.
No man, don't second guess yourself. Saving for retirement is boring. Having money is boring. Life is too short to be boring, you want to be able to look back when you're old (and working at Walmart) and think about all the ways you almost made it rich with very little effort. 
I think you post here just because you like the attention , but I can’t fathom the math on saying you have contributed with match (of any kind) for 11 years and your 401k is only at $20k. 
   
   
 
How about this for TOXX? Specific short-term goals. Measurable. Achievable (I think so, BFC may not). Relevant. Time-bound to the day.
1) Emergency fund: Balance $5000 or higher. Current balance as of 2/20/18 is $1875.
2) Credit card: Zero balance. Current combined balances on all cards is $5776.
3) Personal loan: Paid off completely. Zero balance. Current balance is $5460.
lmao so your toxx is that in an incredibly large amount of time, without making any specific changes to your incredibly lovely behavior, you will magically come out way ahead (still ignoring your gambling debt, though we all know thats the actual plan that you have 'get rich on the gambling')
I predict this is the future of your $3113 (or whatever is left after being scammed away or lost”) - once the hype is over, and people start trying to figure out what these crypto things are useful for, there will be a correction and I really, really struggle to imagine any use for them. (USER WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THIS POST)
Now I just need to pound the 1) Emergency fund building and 2) Pay off the $5460 remaining on personal loan

Most people who buy cryptocurrency just want to sell it back when the price rises and they expect the price to continue to rise because it did in the past. But cryptocurrencies are kind of useless for anything other than selling back when the value increases (because of lack of markets that accept them, constant fluctuation in value, high transaction fees) so most goons think cryptocurrencies cost much more than their actual value. If that's true, you should expect them to drop in price after fear sets in and causes a bunch of adopters to sell for closer to actual value, but we don't know when this will happen. 
(EDIT: Some talk is missing here: namely, bubbles get worse when the government funds investment during the awareness phase, and price drops below actual value because people produce too many of asset X when the price is at its peak. But those things don't really apply to bitcoins.) minority, because their success (whether they realise it or not) depends solely on more people hearing and swallowing their bullshit.
Dogwood, I don't know man. There may end up being none. I've never actually purchased anything with crypto aside from more crypto. I know stuff *has* been purchased, and there are online retailers who accept crypto payments (bitcoin and altcoins) but my thinking about it was they're mostly just test cases and the true believers trying to push adoption. That one headphones site accepts crypto and the CEO has posted some interesting thoughts about the experience. I see people "tipping" crypto on reddit which seems pretty cool/convenient. But again those are all just "crypto people" aka a small section of "ugly, greasy retards" as Chadzok eloquently put it.

 Get 100% of company match (free money!), whatever it might be (401(k) or otherwise), preferably in the lowest-fee index fund available, then15-20% (include #1 in this total) into an IRA or Roth IRA, again into the lowest fee index fund, something like Vanguard is usually a good option
And then just wait. Periodically rebalance things if you want, but only about once a year. Gradually change your balance from most aggressive (foreign and national stocks) to least aggressive (bonds) as you get close to retirement and can tolerate less risk. 
1) 100% of company match = This is done and has been done since it became available in January 2017.
2) lowest-fee index fund = As posted above, I'm currently in the "moderate model" which is a mixture of 15 stock and bond funds. I'm looking at making this one the fund I use instead of the "moderate model", what do you think?
Month End NAV (01/31/2018) $336.35
5-10yrs n/a (inception date 4/10/2013)
3) max out Roth contributions for the year ($1500) = Can you clarify? I'm in a Roth 401k. Isn't the limit $18,000?
4) 15-20% (include #1 in this total) into an IRA or Roth IRA = so that means a total of between 15-20% of my income into retirement savings? aka combine my 401k and IRA together to equal 15-20%?
NOTE: I've actually contributed to my 401k during every pay period possible during the past 16 years, 11 years of those having employment with 401k eligibility. 7 years of that having a % of employer matching. The reason I only have 20k is (1) I've only ever put contributed a small amount ranging between 3-6%. (2) I've withdrawn a lot of it over the years, the main bulk being done when I got divorced, to payoff ex instead of selling my house. That was a dumb decision for sure. I could've kept my IRA, sold the house, split the profits w/ ex, and made out much better.

If I'm already maxing out my employer's 401k match (they contribute 2% of my salary), increasing my total retirement savings can be done via my 401k or IRA right. I mean there's no extra benefit to continue increasing the 401k rate? I suppose people just consider this when they're able to max out the limits? Which I'm not going to get close to anytime soon.

1) IRA contribution limit is $5,500/year, not $1,500 as has been previously stated
2) While the thread’s subject is behind for retirement planning, I’m not sure I would put all future contributions into an S&amp;P; index at that age, and I definitely wouldn’t move all existing balances in the moderate fund over. That moderate fund is going to provide stability to someone we know well is an irrational actor. My recommendation is keep the existing balances and fund 75% S&amp;P;/25% moderate from here.
It would require staying under a monthly spending budget of $904, reduced from $1000 (which I haven't hit yet) for the next 10 months. And then when I start $60 IRA per month in April, the spending budget would reduce to $844.
(unless I can fit any of the above into the monthly spending budget, otherwise I'd have to pull from emergency fund)
(Sidenote, if you multiply hours spent by my salary, this unhelpful post cost $500.)
(If you had played your cards differently ten years ago, you could afford it now, but you didn't, so now you can't. Time and compound interest are cruel.)
(I know why -- you don't want to look too closely at your expenses. It would be embarrassing. Nevertheless, even if you do not share it with us, you need to break those out)

This is an example of what I mentioned before. You seem to see every financial mistake as an outlier rather than recognizing a deeply-seated pattern. It makes you see financial problems as temporary setbacks, and that you'll just avoid making mistakes and get everything back on track. You have bad financial and spending habits, and they don't go away with just willpower. It will require a lot of deliberate effort and strategy (i.e. assuming you are going to gently caress up so make it harder for you to do so, or mitigate the impact).

Ninpo, you're definitely right about one thing. I don't get it. I don't get the panic stricken urgency of it. Sure selling the shitcoins and getting a 2nd job (actually both are on my Goals spreadsheet) will help speed things up a little bit, but the... problem) is that you are treating the low hanging fruit as equivalent in value to the 
That shitcoin money needs to be FIAT currency NOW so it can go toward your DEBT NOW because until you get shot of your interest laden debt you're still spiralling down the drain like the turd that you are in 20-25 years time, assuming that someone with your attitude to risk is even employable at that point because you ARE NOT PUTTING ENOUGH ASIDE FOR RETIREMENT. You're worthless (both literally and pejoratively) and you've hosed about with your braindead financial approach for far too long. You do not have the luxury of time to gamble around with whatever money you could get out of shitcoins TODAY because while they're shitcoins they're not helping your ABSOLUTELY DIRE STRAITS and the longer you wait THE WORSE THOSE ALREADY loving HORRIBLE DIRE STRAITS WILL GET.
If not, why should you feel bad for taking medicine where your brain (chemistry) is broken?
I think you should spend some time reading about asset allocation. When I skimmed the ~700 posts I had missed over the weekend (or since mid last week, the troll is getting boring tbh), I saw you are in some poo poo nasty funds. I'd almost say go all-S&amp;P500;, but at the least I would consolidate what you have a *lot*. You should post your fund options in the LT investing thread. Including ER. And make sure you're doing Traditional... You will not have enough in retirement to get any benefit from Roth. I don't think I'd do a Roth IRA until you *max* your traditional 401k to be honest.
   
   
 
1) You almost surely can't claim traditional contributions as you make too much.
2) Why do you want to do Wealthfront? It's pretty crappy. Vanguard4life. My day trading friends (buy and hold - I don't associate with daytraders :p) do their investing @ Vanguard too. Cheap stock trades, good index funds with no fees.
3) I don't know if I like that allocation... I'd rather know what your funds cost you. But it's better than what you were in.
3.1) Did you put in the change order for existing assets? Do it.
4) Just raise your 401k contribution instead of touching an IRA until you max it. Really. You want the pre-tax benefits.
Income 9535 (about 5k was salary, the rest tax refund)

So, what am I saying now...not really sure. I guess I am trying to say, I still feel that we are good together. I feel you did not give us a chance as I did not know how you were feeling until it was over. I see how your lifestyle is now, and what you need. As I told you before, its not easy to find someone that you are compatible with in many ways. Our core foundations are very compatible. I am sure if you thought about what you would be looking for in a relationship, I would have many of those qualities, if not all:) I know you told me that you don't want a relationship, but what if it was one that met your needs. You never really gave us a chance because you conformed to my schedule and didn't communicate what you desired. You just ended it. What if we discuss it and see if it is something you would want. Think about how we get along, the good times we had, our compatibility, etc...before you just throw it all away. I can't believe I am still here to tell you the truth. I really haven't even tried to move on. I have been very much a homebody myself and have gotten used to it. But I still desire you.
For instance, you can't make money in microMarket by using a predictor bot, even though a predictor bot might occasionally identify a trend successfully. (Well, you can if you play as a character other than Zaurg, because then the game cheats on your behalf day 1.) It has about even chances of getting it right as getting it wrong.
Even if your bot worked, be sure you aren't paying out more than your returns in transaction fees. This is a pretty obvious given, but if your bot promises 10% returns (which is ludicrously high) and each transaction is only about ~$200, and it's all done in bitcoin, then you're eating your entire returns in the form of a $20 transaction fee.
One last horror story: I heard about a great scam targeting (I think) forex people, but I never confirmed it existed. (and I can't remember what security type it was targeting) It was a predictor bot that promised great returns quickly, but rather than doing calculations locally, it fetched them from the botmaster's server. (to keep his methodology secret, the botmaster claimed)
It turns out that it automatically pump-and-dumped a security, then sold it. Everyone running it would autobuy some currency at above market price and resell a short time later once the price went up from being pumped. Of course, the botmaster happened to buy at market price beforehand and all the little minibots bought from him first. This has a pretty good chance of working in the short term (because if you're the second person to buy into a pump and dump scheme, you're not as likely as the third and fourth person to be the last) but keep in mind that the amount of money going into a pump-and-dump has to be the same as the amount going out -- since the botmaster's winnings were guaranteed, you were more likely to experience a loss than a win, and eventually most of those who bought in turned out to be bagholders.

I just went through battling back an impulse decision to move my entire emergency fund and other savings ($3234) over to checking and putting all that towards personal loan $5360. It would help get the loan gone quicker but in the long run I think it's a bad idea for me to continue thinking Emergency fund can be used for non-emergencies, just like 401k cannot be used for non-retirement. Plus if I recall correctly withdrawing my emergency fund would fail my TOXX.

"the median savings in a 401(k) plan for people between the ages of 55 and 64 is currently just $15,000, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security, a nonprofit. "
There's none of that in my family (mom, dad) that I know of. With that said, there could still be factors in my own life that relate to addiction to other things, so yeah it's worth discussing with a professional.

A quiz for you Zaurg, why am I saying this is a bad outcome? If you're such an expert on the tax implications of bitcoin (which you claim to be since you ignored our advice about talking to an accountant) it should be very obvious what's wrong with this person's tax situation.
But most cryptocurrency holders don't actually realize any of those gains; they sit on the cryptocurrency forever, expecting it to gain more and more, forever. That means owning a ton of money to the IRS for money that you don't actually have. That wouldn't be a problem if those holdings continued to gain value, or at least stabilized (because they could just sell some to pay off the tax bill) but the last two months have been very bad for cryptocurrency holders. Most cryptocurrencies have lost half of their value or more. The IRS doesn't give a gently caress about that; they expect you to pay taxes on the gains in 2017 regardless of what's going on in 2018. 
The huge variation in cryptocurrency prices (positive and negative) combined with the extremely high prevalence of fraud and theft in cryptocurrency markets is creating a lot of losers out of people who were hypothetically big winners just a few months ago. Later we'll have to add the inevitable price decline to that list, as bitcoins go the way of pogs and fade from popularity 
Do you understand now why people were urging you to talk to a cpa or an accountant? Your tax situation became very complicated because of your choice to buy shitcoins and I hope that you were able to do the accounting accurately, but that seems pretty unlikely since you gently caress up very simple math in this thread pretty regularly so cross your fingers and hope you don't get audited, I guess. And you should sell your shitcoins because a) you don't have enough net income to afford random spurts of gambling debt, and b) even if your gambling pays off on paper there is a good chance that you will wind up having to pay taxes on income that you'll never get to see. It's like a bet on top of a debt. The risk profile is insanely bad and you have no comprehension of it
   
   
 you sell the coins (or convert them to another coin), right? I assumed the bad part was the 40k tax bill and having to do quarterly estimated taxes for next year. Or having to fill out paperwork explaining the capital gains.
Edit: nvm I see I misread the post; yeah I assumed the best-case scenario of “I bought and held buttcoins and sold them for six-figure profits (without doing any trades).” to lead to “have fun filing paperwork and saving like 40k for next year’s quarterly payments”. 
Immediate usd &gt; bitcoin &gt; shitcoin purchases won't incur (significant) taxes, but if you traded bitcoin to shitcoin from a btc address that had been holding btc for more than a few hours it would be taxable.
Andy, Binance gave me some free BNB (shitcoin), how do I report that on my taxes?

Its miscellaneous income (calc the usd value at the time you received ). Had to do this for bitcoin cash.
a) physical cash that you handed to a person 
b) a credit card
c) another shitcoin
What they (we all, tbh) said was really, really simple.
The tax form was straight-forward was it not? Everyone here just assumed the person who filled out that form did not sell their crypto. I'm guessing whoever posted that image grabbed it from reddit/twitter or something where the person was complaining about being hosed over or something. I mean who the hell would pay 40k tax on something you don't even have??? Makes no sense. You think that makes sense? Of course you don't, you think I'm crazy for holding 3k ($2800) worth of crypto in the hopes it goes back up to $4k.

You sold (as far as the IRS is concerned) your crypto at least once per shitcoin, but you have not sold your crypto for USD yet.
Did you report each of those sales ("dates acquired, dates sold, proceeds, cost basis, gain/loss") to the IRS? Because the website sure did.
Sometimes websites report tax information to the IRS -- for example, if you sell something on EBay for enough money (total in a year), they will prepare a tax document for you (such as a 1099-MISC) and mail it to you and maybe also the IRS. My employer reports tax information to the IRS -- I get a copy of my W2, and so does the IRS (found that out when I hosed up my taxes and they sent me a bill for what I'd messed up). In general, if a website mails you a tax form because you made money on their website, you should assume that the IRS also has a copy of that tax form.). Does that make me the expert now? 
You misunderstood my post. I still say; what is wrong with that guy's tax return? He profited 95k. Explain to me how his life is worse because he profited 95k. Then we can continue. If you're referring to some theoretical situation that he had to pay 40k taxes for 2017 and he didn't sell them for USD and then lost all his shitcoins (or they decreased in value a ton, or got stolen) so he lost all the "money" he "profited" so he never "cashed out" then "fine" I agree, that is horrible and really does open my eyes to one of the more riskier parts of cryptoCURRENCY I had not considered - that you would pay taxes on paper gains (without cashing them out for some reason - still not sinking into my skull - if I'm looking at my year-end numbers and saying well hey I'm up 20,000% maybe I should cash out so I can use some of that cashed out USD to pay for my taxes?)

I mean can we hash out some real use cases here? Mine isn't a good one since I didn't make a dime (on paper, and I certainly haven't cashed out - yet)

scenario 1)
scenario 2)
If you can answer all these correctly, I'm sure the posters here will stop pestering you about your taxes (though I'm sure we will still tell you to sell your shitcoins, because you should).
   
   
  The average buyer who knows how to use the Internet is much better off using a website like Redfin to monitor the market than having their agent do it. (You still want the agent for other things)
And tbh I don't actually know whether Zaurg moving is the best idea. You're starting off with 7% transaction costs, and I don't have a good idea whether he's going to end up with a substantially lower monthly payment given the parameters (3 bedrooms in a good school district in the same city).
Generally yes I agree with that (bolded part). They'll try to set the sale price a little lower than optimal potential with the goal of getting the transaction completed. Obviously it depends on the urgency of the transaction from the seller's point of view as well - sometimes faster is more important. But I'm certainly no expert.

- There is nothing in my divorce agreement that says the kids must live in this house or must have their own bedrooms. The only requirement is a 25 mile distance from current location, which seems reasonable to me. I wouldn't want ex to move 100 miles away and demand kids go with her or something. gently caress that. I'll live here and she can live here too (25 miles north or south is a large area).
- NOT in the divorce agreement is the memory of negotiations w/ ex where I straight up told her she cannot afford to live in this house (I know, I can't either, but she really couldn't. She wanted me to move out and she keep the house), so me staying here was the only option, or we sell the place. So she eventually agreed w/ me staying here and keeping the house, in her mind it was better that way so the kids could continue keeping this as their main home, instead of moving them two different places all at once. 
I agree with the dude who said all that is a luxury. I agree with Andy that it doesn't seem like a super crazy % that I'm paying towards a home. Try looking up rentals for 2 (forget 3) bedroom apartments around here and I wouldn't be saving a ton and it would be a lovely apartment (letting go of the current luxury of a single family home). 
Controlling expenses (and gambling/mental health!) while taking steps to get debt free and incrementally increase savings seems to be the best option to me.
I know the problem well. You really need to work on a consistent bed time. Its a loving pain. I'm so bad about it on the weekends, and if I stay up till 3 on Saturday and sleep in till 11 or noon Sunday, its super hard to get to bed by 2200 so I'm up with ease at 6... I've noticed my sleep cycle is massively worse when I'm under stress from things totally in my control - studying, in my case. I find amazing ways to distract myself, like reading the interweb (news), posting on SA and playing with spreadsheets!
First I would put all transactions in the spreadsheet - all income, 401k/savings transfers, etc. Then I would tag transactions a little further. Keep your descriptions, but add a master category and a sub category. You don't have to get near as detailed as I do, I just find it easier to have a lot of categories... I think we could dig up a category guide thread on r/YNAB probably. I know I saw some when I was looking for other YNAB stuff. I've built my (Quicken) categories over the last decade based on what I wanted to be able to "report on" if you will. I use a pivot table to summarize everything, so I can drill in really easily and see the underlying transaction - payee, memo, maybe a tag, etc.
I dislike the whole "[previously $1,000/mo] $800/mo misc spending money" idea. I would prefer if it was, say, $100/mo house/car savings (prolllly should be more), $200/mo kids, $350/mo food, $150/mo ZaurgBlowAndHookers. Then you roll balances forward to the next month and you accrue for expenses that way. For example, I have a petcare line item on my budget that rarely gets used for anything outside of a bag of dog food every ~45 days and a box of treats whenever they go on sale at Costco (~quarterly), but because I budget a flat amount in there, I have enough to take him to the vet for check up's, get his teeth cleaned, and anything else that comes up without touching the monthly budget. I prefer software to track transaction vs just Excel, too. I find it so much easier to download all transactions from my banks into Quicken.

I dislike the whole "[previously $1,000/mo] $800/mo misc spending money" idea. I would prefer if it was, say, $100/mo house/car savings (prolllly should be more), $200/mo kids, $350/mo food, $150/mo ZaurgBlowAndHookers. Then you roll balances forward to the next month and you accrue for expenses that way. For example, I have a petcare line item on my budget that rarely gets used for anything outside of a bag of dog food every ~45 days and a box of treats whenever they go on sale at Costco (~quarterly), but because I budget a flat amount in there, I have enough to take him to the vet for check up's, get his teeth cleaned, and anything else that comes up without touching the monthly budget. I prefer software to track transaction vs just Excel, too. I find it so much easier to download all transactions from my banks into Quicken.
   
   

So like, you have all those great categories, with let's say $100 assigned to Car Repairs per month (I spent $121 per month in 2017, which seems high), then during March when you spend $225 on a car repair, an expense entry is entered and the category is set to "Car Repairs". 
Car repairs are a year round thing. Not only do I put money in for major repairs, but also for preventive maintenance and upkeep, such as armor all, rainx, oil changes, wiper blades, car washes (midwest winters will eat cars).
then when I have those expenses come up (auto insurance, water bills, auto registration, summer camp) I pull the $ from there
Lol. Until you can pay your debts (public or private) with the results, you didn't sell anything (except for tax purposes, of course)
Hey Team, I invested a sizable portion of this month's budget ("budget") in a HLBP converter and have been using BFC HLBP as fuel. Thank you all. Please keep the tampons out though as it causes clogs.
- I can't blame ex-wife forever. I blame my inability to communicate and negotiate and compromise with her. I was unable and would back-slide... or more accurately just flat out give up. Seeing my old "Debt free by 2016" plan recently really shook me. I want that again. I have that (well not exactly that) plan again. And I'm doing it. Not at exactly the speed in which BFC suggests, but at my own speed. Just how I've taken to running. I started by walking a couple miles. Then jog/walk a bit. Then finally a 5k under 40 mins. Then under 30mins. Slow progress over time. Then under 20mins. Finding new goals to reach. 
   
   
 
I sold 11 coins (FCT, ARDR, NXT, RDD, DASH, XMR, TRX, BNB, MOD, OST, DOT) and used the BTC from those sales to buy 2 new coins (MCO, MANA).
This is why I keep hammering on that accountability poo poo, Zaurg. Because you don't hold yourself accountable ever. You start doing something that would be good for you, then start waffling, make up excuses, and fall off the path. Then you pretend it's okay for a while. Then you have regrets, then you wanna do better (or at least you say you do, for real life it's equally worthless) and you start doing something that would be good for you. Then waffling again, etc.
Holding yourself accountable means actually dealing with the mistakes you make. Not hating on yourself or something, but dealing with it for real and not by ignoring or deferring. If you'd hold yourself accountable, that moment you describe in the quote would have gone much differently. You would have started selling the shitcoins, would have noticed your waffling on the matter, and you would have said "stop, brain. I'm noticing your poo poo". Therapists often adress this via CBT and similiar exercises to help you change your thought patterns. But holding yourself accountable by noticing when you are slipping and not just being along for the ride of whatever your whims take you to is the first and most important step. No simple "aw gee whiz, guess I messed up again!" after the fact. Nope. Actually 1) noticing it when it happens and 2) taking consequences, no matter the outcome. (USER WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THIS POST)
At least in the examples above, some action was actually taken. The more noticeable issue I see with myself and other people is announcing your plans to the world. "I'm gonna start a new diet today! Here's all the details". "Starting a new workout regimen, here's the spreadsheet". Receive a lot of accolades (for doing nothing yet). Complete 1 or 2 days of said plan. Then nothing. This is something I really noticed a couple years ago and purposely attacked this problem when I started running. I didn't tell anyone my plan. I would occasionally mention AFTER completing a run/workout/a few weeks of progress, but beforehand? No, I kept that all to myself. It worked well at least for that. Also did that for improving my diet.

We're actually not sickly people. I guess our health insurance (BlueCross BlueShield) is expensive. She gets it from her employer and added me on, and the rates just went up, so it is $320/month. I need to shop around on that, because we'll be adding a 3rd person (baby) very soon. As for the $226/month medical expenses, I will look closer at that. I think I categorized a lot of her pregnant-related bills as Medical which would explain that amount.
Both employed but my work is part-time at nights. So she will stay home for 8 weeks (4 of that are paid, 4 weeks we have saved for). After she goes back to work I will care for baby in morning and work at night. That's the plan.
Actually it's $552/year (she takes them, I don't), which is still insane. I buy multivitamin and fish oil from bodybuilding.com so I spend about $7/month on my vitamins.

- cpr class - we thought it would be a good idea to learn cpr (infant/child/adult) before having a kid. Now that I think about it would could have learned the same thing for free online.
2001 Civic (paid off years ago)
We just buy a lot of little poo poo (daily) which adds up quickly.
I think a lot of this has to do with my wife and I not being on the same page and not having the same goals (or lack of goals) for way too long. Going to use a lot of this thread's info when we sit down and talk this weekend.

=SUMPRODUCT(SUMIF(INDIRECT("'08"&amp;ROW;(INDIRECT("1:12"))&amp;"'!M2:M50"),A3,INDIRECT("'08"&amp;ROW;(INDIRECT("1:12"))&amp;"'!N2:N50")))

*property taxes (if you have them) - screw you uncle sam
Also if you guys ahve a chance take a look at some of the stuff Dave Ramsey has done. He does a wonderful program called Financial Peace University that I highly reccomend. He has good advice not only on getting out of debt and saving for college but also info on insurance (which with having a baby is gonna change a bunch of stuff), raising your kids to be good with money, and why giving money to help those in need is a good thing. He is a devout christian, but he keeps the messages to a very neutral lvl and never hits you over the head with the bible (I am not christian and had no issues with it). 
Currently on the 1400 min cell phone plan which is way too much (have a lot of rollover mins), but 700min is too little at times. If you guys know of a service that has something in between please clue me in.
I never really thought of her as ridiculously high maintenance, she just likes to stick her head in the sand and not look at $$, which is exactly what she did with school. She just wanted to go get a degree and focus 100% on the actual school and not worry about the $$ or else she felt should wouldn't continue with the school if she worried too much about the $. I'm the EXACT opposite, I have to know where every penny is going, I called Comcast 3 times when they kept charging us $0.28 a month for something we didn't have. She would have let that poo poo keep on going for years. She also let something like a drat "Payment Protection" on her credit cards go on for years which I exploded about (CapitalOneShit.xls is way too large of a file, seriously I had to make a spreadsheet of her various Payment Protection, Account Balance Coverage Premium, "PlanPlus", a handful of scams.) and had to call for her to cancel them. Ok now I'm getting back to bashing the wife... breathe....
Additional note about the Random Snacks/Drinks category. I think twice in the past week a situation came up where the wife was going to buy something and I said "do we really need that?" and she replied "it's only three bucks!". And look at that, $24.85/month on random "only three bucks" items = $300/year. I need to get this through to her. (I said this same thing to myself a few times this week when I had the urge to buy beer or a stupid monster energy drink and decided to drink some water instead, or something I had at home already.)

Bodily Injury Liability ($10,000 each person/$20,000 each accident) = $107.00
Property Damage Liability ($25,000 each accident) = $82.00
Personal Injury Protection ($10,000 limit, $1000/person deductible) = $159.00
Comprehensive (Actual Cash Value) ($1000 deductible) = $69.00
Collision (Actual Cash Value) ($1000 deductible) = $96.00
Bodily Injury Liability ($10,000 each person/$20,000 each accident) = $85.00
Property Damage Liability ($25,000 each accident) = $65.00
Personal Injury Protection ($10,000 limit, $1000/person deductible) = $126.00
So let's say we get a hurricane and a boat lands on the Honda and totals it. Progressive will give us at most $3755 ($4755 minus 1k deductible)? And we're paying about $320/year for that? (fixed math)

n8r and Ahz (AND Zhentar) got me concerned about auto insurance now. I'm trying to determine how much we need and should have. YES, I currently only have the Florida required minimum of 10/20/10 for Bodily Injury &amp; Property Damage.
Life insurance figures into how much your estate will be worth (i.e. when you're dead). That's not relevant here.
Why the gently caress would you have comprehensive coverage but reject UIM? You do realize that if you, your wife, and your baby are t-boned by an idiot with $10k/$20k limits (oh hey that sounds familiar), you'll have a grand total of $30k to pay all of your medical bills, assuming your insurance and the tortfeasors pay policy limits?
drat. I started at this to reduce auto insurance costs and now I'm increasing it a couple hundred a year. All these quotes are from the same company (Progressive) so I will compare them to a couple others. which of these would you go with? 
2001 Honda Civic LX Coupe 2D (Value estimated at $5115)
1993 Saturn SL1 4D (Value estimated at $1280)
(increased) Bodily Injury &amp; Property Damage: 100/300/100
(new) Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist: 100/300/Non-Stacked
(same) Personal Injury Protection: Basic/$1000 Deductible/Named Insured &amp; Resident Relatives
(new) Medical Payments: $1000 each person
(removed) Comprehensive and Collision on Honda: None
(same) Comprehensive and Collision on Saturn: None
Next I have to install the other base in my Saturn and make sure everything secure hooks up. Also need to make sure the stroller fits in the Civic's trunk, forgot about that tonight. So I think (knock on wood) we're good with the 2 cars we have for now.

The only accident I've been in involved USAA. On I-95, a young kid in a Chevy Suburban slammed into the back of a Jeep, into a Neon, into me (Altima), into a Van. Totaled the Suburban, Jeep, Neon, and my Altima.
ok I have no clue what I'm doing here but it's done and it will be tracked in August. I'm expecting we'll be way off and have to modify it quite a bit going into September. I also think I'm forgetting to categorize some stuff but I want it as simple as possible like Zombie Dictator posted a couple pages ago (the less categories the better).
Retirement $- (can't do this right now, plan on implementing it in a month or two once we get the rest of the budget somewhat solidified)
StudentLoans $- (won't have to pay these back for a while but put the category here anyway)
HealthInsurance $250 (currently paying $320/mo but I think we can do better)
DentalInsurance $50 (if we move to Humana Dental is included with their health ins plan)
DisabilityInsurance $- (don't have)
CellPhone $100 (currently paying $130/mo, we can do better)
AutoRegistration $5 (why i put this in its own category i don't know)
PersonalJ $100 (me personal crap)
PersonalT $100 (wife personal crap)
   
   

I have a lot of stuff to respond to but I'll hit this now before heading off to work as it should entice quite a few more replies in addition to my quick and dirty budget. One problem with this crap is so many people around her encourage her with them, INCLUDING her OB doctor. I think the Doc said they were fine for her because 1) they're actually not bad for her health-wise, and 2) the Doc wasn't considering anything financial regarding those vitamins. So my point is people around her and her doctor said keep taking them so she is and my input hasn't overridden that.
She is taking a daily multivitamin(One A Day Essential), additional 400mcg folic acid, iron, and the juice plus. So that is folic acid 800mcg, iron 50mg, and the One A Day is a pretty simple multivitamin that has 100% for the major things like Vitamin A, C, D, etc (no iron). I've reviewed  
Our current health insurance coverage (BlueCross BlueShield) is through wife's employer. But her employer is a small company and they only pay $75/month, we pay the rest. So to cover wife and I it is $320/month and with that we get a $1500 deductible, then 50/50 coinsurance. Before I lost my job in 2008 we had insurance through my employer and we paid $200/month, had same deductible and coinsurance was much better at 80/20. Obviously it helps a lot when your employer pays a big chunk.
I got a quote from Humana the other day for $320/month to cover the whole family. The preventative care, regular office visit co-pays, dental care included, and coinsurance is 80/20, all looks good. But the deductible is much higher at $5000 so it does not make sense to switch now when she's 2 weeks away from due date and we've already paid her OB doctor for the delivery (as long as it's a normal vag delivery and not a c-section, then the price goes up) - what I'm saying is we're already way over the $1500 deductible with BCBS.
Are you guys using one or just going straight to formula? I'm assuming you guys are not going to go with a manual pump because you'll need to pump regularly since your wife will be working, the breast pump alone will cost around $100 (for a mid range) - $250 for a high end range model so even if you only need that one thing, it doesn't seem like you've done a great job budgeting for that one item. 
Yes, we will be trying very hard to use breastmilk as a sole food source for the first 6 months and definitely getting a good pump. We took a 2 hour class with a RN/Lactation specialist this weekend and it looks so easy (hey, I sucked on my mom's boobs for over a year, but that was back in the 70's) but all I ever hear from moms lately is how difficult it is and how they give up after 2 weeks and go straight to formula. So we'll see. 
I'm sure you'll also find some surprises along the way - you run out of Desitin, your bottle brushes crap out faster than you expect, your wife goes through her post-maternity bras too fast, you need more breast pads, or whatever. Also, stocking up on diapers can be problematic. If you have a big baby, he may actually be too big for newborn size diapers, for example (is it a girl or boy?). Or he/she may grow too fast and not go through all of them from a particular type of pack. He may get colic, whatever - you're probably not as prepared as you think you are. I'd say $100 could be good at first but not when you've completely excluded something major like a breast pump (if you are going to use one).
I also don't see any room for co-pays. Are you including that in your insurance cost somewhere? Your baby, even if healthy, will definitely be going to visit the doctors a LOT at first and you're going to have to pay something. Have you checked to see what's included in your plan right now vs. later? You really want things like NICU to be covered if you're planning on changing before the birth and "well-child" care vs. just sick child care (immunizations &amp; check ups), plus all your wife's non-necessary expenses like extra hospital stays, epidurals, etc. Don't scrimp now without being very very careful of what's getting excluded.
Savings $0 (changed from 250)
Unexpected $0 (changed from 75)
Baby $250 (changed from 100)
HealthInsurance $320 (changed from 250)
DentalInsurance $0 (changed from 50, included with Humana insurance plan)
Gifts	$50 (added new category, forgot before)
ok is this line of thinking crazy or sound: Removed the budgeted amounts for savings because we 1) have $10k in savings right now and 2) have to pay the credit cards off first.
Great question and I think this is a big reason behind us not (so far) converting to a low budget lifestyle. I know this is in the wife's head and I think this sometimes. "How could our situation be dire when"...
- We're "getting by" right now but if we don't change our ways we'll only be "getting by" week to week for the next 30+ years. That is until the poo poo hits the fan (odds say it will at some point right? both lose job, become disabled, both cars die... a combination of things) and we'll end up filing for bankruptcy/foreclosing/something serious like that.
Too many what-if questions for me. We're not getting a drat hurricane because after the last bad year in South FL (2005 iirc) we went out and bought expensive shutters, haven't seen a storm since.
- increase income (I'm lining up 2 other part-time things for me)
(done) - cancel netflix

There are a ton of these questions. What happens if it turns out she needs a c-section instead of normal vaginal delivery? Double the cost. What happens if she wants an epidural (she will)? Extra cost. It is inevitable that we will still need to pay somewhere in the thousands more to the hospital/OB doctor. It is not a question of if, but when and how much. Impossible to say exactly how much. Our financial planning or lack of regarding having a child was extremely poor I admit this and now we're just trying to apply bandaids.

No. If I was single I could get quite a bit closer to that (I did in the past), but together with my wife, no, impossible.
Also regarding credit cards, 2 of my cards have had the credit limits cut in half in the past 6 months. This happened even though we haven't missed payments. I assume the reasons are that 1) high balances carried for extended time and 2) credit card companies are scared we'll max out the poo poo and go bankrupt.

Can you explain your wife's thinking to us though? I mean, what do the conversations generally sound like when you explain this all to her? As a female, it's baffling - I cannot for the life of me imagine wanting my $100 in "personal" to go to vitamins, or at least half to vitamins. I'd much rather have new clothes, a day at the spa to relax, a haircut, a gym membership, a nice dinner out with a girlfriend, anything FUN... what is it about these vitamins where she's willing to give up so many other things to have them (I realize she's fighting to make them seem like a necessary expense but I really suggest you don't give in on that)? Is she really, truly realizing she'll be giving up all those things or is there still this general thought that you can guys can always just dip into savings if you want something not budgeted for because it'll only cost a little and you have so much? 
As for my wife's thinking, we talked a lot last night. Went over the budget I whipped up and she liked most of it, changed a few things, I'll post the revised soon. Regarding those vitamins, her reasoning is they help her poop. She says when she's taking them regularly (at least during pregnancy) she can go every day and when she's not it's more like every 2-3 days and it very uncomfortable. So now my goal is to find something to replace that - get some extra fiber somewhere in regular food or supplement should be easy to do without paying $46/month. The vitamins are $46/month by the way, which is still a ton.
Mother's day (2 moms)
Sister moving into new apartment (bought 30 kitchen/household type items at the dollar store, so about $35 spent. We considered this was going cheap.)
2 cousins (spreadsheet showed about $60 spent, can't remember what it was or for)
Father's day (4 dads - hey divorce runs in the family)
Just got a 4th quote on daycare for infant (6wks+). $263/week. drat. $263/40hrs = $6.58/hr. So if I got a full-time day job for $10/hr it would pay for daycare plus extra to go towards cc debt.
Not sure about the "instantly replaceable" part though. Haven't had one ounce of luck even getting an interview since losing my job last year. When I applied for Tech Support monkey jobs back in 2001 (with much less experience) I got a dozen interviews and a job within a few weeks. Perhaps I have become a yammering retard.

Another thing I realized, we have $235 in grocery and entertainment gift cards. Going to use those (but try to make them last, don't go spending wildly just because they're gift cards) in September when wife is on maternity leave.

Currently we pay $132/month (tax included) for 2 cell phones, 1400 minutes, and 400 txt msgs per phone. If we drop the service for 2 phones to 700 minutes and the minimal text message addon (200/month) the monthly price goes down to $99 which includes tax. That puts $33 back into our account to pay towards debt.
Last 9 months cell phone usage (Anytime mins. This doesn't include the unlimited nights/weekends/m2m)
You know, I was going to ask how on earth you could possibly be on the phone 47 minutes a day every day, not counting nights, weekends, and m2m, and then I remembered some chick in the fabric store yesterday, talking to her friend about what the friend should make for dinner, what was the best Hamburger Helper (cheesy shells, apparently), what kinds of yarn the store had, which ones she liked the best, what she was going to use the yarn for, on and on and on. My own thoughts in my head weren't that boring, I don't know why she had to spend good money to discuss them with her friend and everyone in the store.
Over the past 9 months we've averaged about 28 minutes a day (from 6am-9pm), so that's 14 mins a day each. Doesn't seem like a lot to me but drat we have to cut something these phones are expensive.
Dropping AT&amp;T; cell phone plan to 550 mins (lowest available) and getting the cheapest Vonage plan (about $29/mo) would run us $118/month.
Bottom line is we need to earn more money because we aren't able to live on a budget and having a child is more expensive than I thought (give me the I told you so's, please).
Also I updated my "Cost of Having a Baby" worksheet. Guess what the total is since January? This is with health insurance ($1500 deductible).

Anesthesiologist billed insurance company $3084. $744 is the amount we have to pay... deductible was already met so this was 50% co-insurance. A better insurance plan (80/20 for example) and we would have only had to pay about $300.

I'm actually impressed though if I'm reading this correctly. Over two months you made $3500 (4 weeks paid leave) + whatever you made while your wife wasn't working (4 weeks). You spent over $3,500 both months, and your epidural/copay cost $2,224.

It's just... I mean... drat, I don't get it how it could cost this much for a 2-year online degree. And like a few mentioned earlier in this thread it probably won't result in her making any more money. Is everyone (and their husbands) who attends DeVry a retard who ends up with a boatload of debt and nothing to benefit from it?
Need to confirm but it looks like this is all of it. We've only received notices for repaying 3 of them so far, the terms and payments varying with each. ($50, $50, and $115... 4yrs, 8yrs, 9yrs respectively.)

Come on now. You know there are millions... ok thousands... ok maybe hundreds of people in this country (USA! USA! USA!) in worse financial shape than we are. I'm just crazy enough to post details about it for a bunch of goons. I knew I'd get some sound advice and some needed heckling here.

Nope, it was a metaphor of your denial that you're in bad shape by deflecting to the fact that there are many others in worse (financial) shape than you.
I don't know. Good question. I think it's more along the lines of 1) it's a birthday/holiday, you buy a gift, money is not important. and 2) in her mind we're paid up on all our bills, not behind on anything, basically just maintaining our current status, so we'll continue with what we were doing.
So you've put a $112 dent into your debt (not including student loans)? I don't get it. You paid down your credit card by $462, but you also spent $350 of your savings.
The rest ($3677) is in cash/checking to use for paying bills, paying off CC, spending on football, etc. Wife got paid yesterday and we made two CC payments as well as November's mortgage and other bills.

You put the $25 (which isn't enough, by the way) AWAY every month, so that when you have a $300 bill, you have the cash right there earmarked for car repairs and you don't have to put them on a credit card. No wonder you can't understand how desperately broke you are.
Well, I was planning on going to 4 more games this year. 3 home games and 1 away game. The away game would require a hotel for a night, which I already reserved but could cancel up to the night before the game (about 6 weeks from now). Hotel is $34, ticket $41.
This thread is over. Either it's a troll, he is now pretending its a troll because he is so embarassed of how much he actually really sucks (I think this is very likely) or he hasn't hit bottom yet and isn't ready to start. Either way, there's no advice that we can give that he will take. He hasn't put away his credit cards, they haven't stopped shopping at name brand stores like Babies R Us and Victoria Secret, and he can't comprehend the idea of a budget and sticking to it and hasn't actually seriously broached the subject with his wife despite talking about it for 3+ months. There's nothing here until he hits rock bottom and is forced to learn. Either we turn this thread into something productive or it should really die.
It is accounted for. It was not used to pay down debt, it was used for the football game earlier tonight. Yes it counts towards my entertainment (personal, actually) budget.

I should have gone more in-depth with that answer. When I get a decent job (not delivering pizza) and that job requires work on Saturday, I'll work Saturday. The delivery job offers me a lot of flexibility and so I schedule my 4-5 days of work around Saturday. Friday and Sunday end up being the best days to work for delivery anyway (yes - I have a detailed spreadsheet with stats).
I don't make gobs of money, but I do alright. It helps that I've managed to cut my overhead to a shadow of its former self--I almost never eat out, I avoid bars and I ride my bike to work. I'm also working with my job to structure it such that I can sell my car since the need for it has vanished over the past two years. (I originally was required to have it when I got hired). 
Now, I've got a modest savings account going which is already 1/3 of the way there towards the budget for my next record, I'm going to be completely CC debt free in about 3 months and I'll be able to start thinking about building a nice cushion so when (and you know it's a matter of when) my cat gets sick I'll be like "no problem little dude. I got the vet money right here. Have some catnip!"
1) Need more income. Bottom line. Many have already said this. I can spend 4 hours a day analyzing our spending here and there to save money but in the end we still need more income. 
2) We're both &gt; 30 years old and have been doing things the same way our whole life. Neither of us is ready to completely shut off any little social life we do have and to act like total cheapasses to friends and family. 
3) Going to talk to the wife tonight and set 3 goals. I think having some short/long-term goals in mind DAILY will help us cut back on the unnecessary spending. Will make us think twice before shelling out "only 50 bucks" for 
   
   
 
- Earlier in the day she brought up buying a SUV again (within the next month, because her grandmother said she would buy her car from her at blue book value) and instead of suggesting we sit down and go over the $ while considering the student loans, cc debt, etc, I was a total sarcastic rear end to her. Didn't go well. Also she started talking about selling the condo and buying a house and I just lost it. 
- Haven't counted. Would have to count the email autoresponses and ones I logged in excel. I can do that later. More effort than beyond online? Like going to a store and applying? The only time I applied in person was for the delivery job (hit about 6 pizza places iirc). All the others have been online but remember I haven't applied to any other retail type places or grocery stores or whatever, aside from Costco yesterday, which was online.
Also to follow-up on that if I've done more than apply online... my dad always asks me if I followed up on the application. I don't know how that is done really. I've tried calling a corporate office, asking for HR, and asking if they received my application and every time the answer is yes and you'll hear from us. I don't know what "following up on" means if you don't know the hiring manager's name and direct #, and even then is it normal to call them or would they get pissed off thinking you're harrassing them? I don't have a lot of experience with job hunting. Last time I sent out a bunch of resumes/applications was in 2001 and got a response to every single one and a handful of interviews. And before that I'd apply for a job and get it (grocery store when I was 16, tv production company when I was ~20, temp work photoshopping all day when I was 22, pizza delivery when I was 23, then the tech support job I got in 2002-2008).
 IRS) and enroll in their "Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness" program. I'll spare you the details, but essentially what happens is you fill out the following forms, and the IRS will work with your creditors to assume your debt on behalf of the United States government. This debt is pooled together and discharged to interested parties through a series of T-bill exchanges and associated LIBOR adjustments. Your creditors and the US government split the proceeds, and your debt is forgiven. There's a lot more to it than that, but you can google the program name if you want more information.
Ok. One reason I kept two nights off (monday, wednesday) was to spend time home with wife and help her out with school and now baby. I will discuss this with her first. I will try to compromise with her this way;
a) Talk to your manager about picking up more shifts.
b) Make an honest attempt at making a budget which covers everything, including the student loans. Call it your 2010 budget. It doesn't have to balance. Just make a list of your income and expenses, and try to cut out various things to make it work a little better. Then bring it to the table with your wife, feel free to act dumb, and tell her you don't know how to find the money to buy her the car she wants. Let her feel sorry that you're just trying to give her what she wants, and then let her try to find the money. If that doesn't work, then that's a problem for next week. Don't fight, and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Okay?).
We have 2 cards right now that have 0 balances but have $59 annual fees. One of them is my wife's oldest card. Do you think we should cancel those cards to get rid of the annual fees? Maybe call them (Capital One) and tell them we're closing that account unless they waive the fee?

visa 1649.08 bal (majority of this balance is on 0% APR from a balance xfer we did in August), 2000 limit, 22.90%, 
- I don't have a gambling problem. Yes I used to play some low-stakes online poker, the majority of that being from 2005-2006. Made a very very small profit (if you're going by hourly wage) and played mostly for entertainment. It's fun but the time invested is ridiculous unless you're one of those multi-table gurus with quad monitors or whatever. Anyway this is a non-issue.
Income 3500 (after taxes)
- 3500 is about the low end of what we are currently earning per month so that's what I'm using to budget with. If we earn more than that (October we earned 3646) the remainder will go towards CC debt. Get a job to increase this.
- The average bill over the past 2 years has been $133/month. I'm setting the budget to $120 and I've set the A/C thermostat to 77 while at home. Had it at 75 24x7 when wife was pregnant and at 76 lately. Will keep it at 77 and up it to 79 when not home. Maybe use the fan in the bedroom if we get a bit warm at night until we get used to it. I think this does make a difference just based on how often the A/C is running. We already shut off everything when not using (except 1 computer which I leave on) and use energy efficient light bulbs. Not sure what else to do. I personally could handle the A/C set at 80 but the wife would move out.
- Still not sure what we need here. August 812, Sept 778, Oct 204. October was 3 things: 144 for stuff bought at onestepahead.com (need to check with wife to see what it was. whatever it was I haven't used it yet), 35 for doctor copay, 25 for stocking up on diapers (had a coupon, costco).
- More freakin insurance! Current plan we're on (Progressive) is 626.20 every 6 months.
- Our average the past 3 months has been 378. The key to hitting 350 or less is to have me do all the shopping, not the wife. And no random stops to the grocery store (wife), we went to the grocery store 10 times in October which is nuts. Need to make a list at home first of necessities and get only that. Checked out a Super Walmart today, found some better deals on a few things. Some stuff is still cheaper at Costco or Target, but I'm working on it.
- 6mbit DSL. Getting it at a discounted rate (real monthly price is 47.95) and I'm not sure why. I don't want to call them to find out, maybe 27.95 will stay for good. If/when it does jump back to 47.95, I will downgrade to 1.5mbit DSL for 37.95/month or try to work a similar deal. Comcast cable would be cheaper (for the first 6 months) but I tried it a couple years ago and it was horribly unstable.
- Last week came home and there was a box of JUICE PLUS (the super expensive MLM vitamins) at the door. Wife had called her MLM person to cancel it weeks beforehand as we agreed, so this was a bit upsetting. Wife is still trying to get in contact with that person. If no contact is made in the next day we'll have to contact the company directly. Need to return this! $320 worth of that crap
I gave her a printout of what I posted earlier (minus a couple of my comments) and asked her to review and we'll discuss it tonight. She seemed very receptive and glad she actually had something to read rather than just listening to me ramble. Her only comment was that "well we're just going to have to make more money".
If you put the juice plus on a credit card, and (hopefully) can prove you called the juice plus people to cancel, you can almost certainly get away with sending the product back and, if they refuse to refund your money, issue a chargeback. I'm almost guaranteeing that MLM companies are not eager to give out refunds on their wares, so this is probably what will wind up happening if you're on top of things. Credit card companies deal with shady peddlers all the time, and I can almost guarantee that if you have any evidence of cancellation whatsoever they'll be on your side.
And zaurg, I'm assuming that the online poker isn't an issue anymore and hopefully it can get put behind us in this thread. I know someone who's family was basically destroyed by gambling addiction (though at physical casinos and not online). It's nothing to gently caress around with.
It's going to be hard for me not to start a huge arguement tonight over this juice plus thing. Asked her dozens of times over the past 4-5 months to make sure the order is cancelled and what happens? The past 2 orders still come in (enough ML gimmicky vitamins for the Duggars). This last order she did actually talk to her "representative" MLM seller and supposedly cancelled it but it came anyway. The last time this happened we kept one box and sold the rest on ebay at a significant loss of $. 
So, yes, it is billed on credit card in 4 installments of 88.00. The first charge already went through and my wife already paid it for some reason. Wife called Juice Plus directly today and of course they won't take it back or refund, I am not surprised. I think issuing a chargeback at this point is the best option. Another option would be to cancel the credit card (0 balance) and sell the vitamins, but I'd guess JP would come after us.
- make-up (beauticontrol)
- some type of candles (we have cabinets full of candles that have been sitting there for 2+ years)
I actually don't regret that purchase since it does help protect us if the big one hits, and is safer and a billion times easier than lugging big sheets of plywood and Tapcon'ing them into the walls on a 2nd story condo (did that in 2004).
- 1k anniversary night (concert and expensive hotel)
1) Last night she read over the budget and she suggested these changes:
2010 BUDGET (updated 11/4/09)
And the problem with gifts. Shortly after we went over that, I asked her about gifts and whether she thought we should get each other and the baby gifts. She still wants to get gifts for 6 kids and a Wii for us, which she rationalized by saying it would be for a) her birthday, b) our christmas, and c) our anniversary which is coming up too. Then she pulled out some from the huge stack of catalogs she has and asked me what I thought about a certain gift for my niece. I took one look, saw it was $40 and said I didn't want to discuss that now (because I knew I was just going to get mad at her).
3) Student Loan. She really didn't have a clue as to how much DeVry cost. I gave her her own Wachovia login and showed her the long list of loans. She was actually mad at me... for I guess not stopping her or something early on. We are such a clusterfuck of idiocy sometimes I couldn't do anything but laugh. How do you go through a interview and sign up for school and pay bills and get loans and grants and force yourself to stay completely oblivious to what it actually costs? Because that is what she did. I didn't get angry about it last night, I just said "yeah, it costs about the same as a private university, pretty expensive, but you're almost done and now you have something to put on your resume". I figured that was much better than telling her how I really feel.
4) I'm expecting to get raped for this... and I should... I've only applied for 4 jobs since 10/17. I don't have an excuse other than "I've been doing a bunch of other stuff". My goal is to apply for 20 jobs before Saturday morning. I have Thursday night, Friday morning, and Friday night to get that done.

Come on man, at least read my entire post. Do you think we're taking diapers away from her? Making her wear dirty diapers for 12 hours or something? Feeding her less? If you'd read my post you know that wasn't it. We moved baby medical copays to it's own category "Medical" and based on October's spending, thought 250 was a little on the high side. Over a year's time 150 x 12 = 1800... thought that would be enough for diapers, wipes, formula, clothes when she needs them (got two dressers and a closet full right now). 
I agree the Wii is dumb. She said it would help us spend time together at night instead of me sitting at the computer and her watching tv/doing homework while we rotate baby shifts. I said we always fight in the middle of playing games and we probably wouldn't use it that much just like the PS2 years ago (collected dust).
After work, in the 11pm-3am timeframe (now). Or all night long and don't sleep, like necrobobsledder.

2010 BUDGET (updated today)
FLPrepaid 35 /0/50/0 (this starts in Jan)
Mortgage 734 /750 (Asked my wife tonight if she could start paying the exact amount, even though it's only an extra 16, and it's technically going towards paying down debt, we have that 16 allocated elsewhere. She looked at me like I'm an idiot and said I should be focusing on something other than finances.)
HOA 290 /285 (This jumps to 290 in January)
Electric 125 /143 (This has increased the past couple months because we are on a "budgeted billing" system from FPL. So even though our actual electric usage went down the past two months the bill increased because it is averaged over 12 months.)
HealthDentalIns 320 /312 (all paid for November. This will go to 307 in January, plus whatever we figure out for adding dental coverage for wife)
HomeOwnersIns 38 /0 (current policy expires in May)
AutoIns 104 /0 (current policy expires in Feb)
Phone 100 /120 (finally got the plan dropped, Nov was prorated. Dec the total charge should drop to $89.98 plus tax)
AutoMaintenance 80 /596 (new tires, brakes, and oil changes. get new tires about every 4 years)
Gifts 30 /153 (see below)
10/6/09	Gifts	pictures $75.00 (not sure why we classified this as a gift. I think we ordered pics and thought since we're giving a bunch of them away, let's classify half the amount as gift)
11/13/09	Gifts	weddingthing	$117.05 (wife bought some wedding survival kit for my sister without telling me)
- Florida Prepaid for my niece is a college savings account we opened for her a couple years ago. I think it's time to ask her mom (my sister) and maybe my mom to help out with contributions.
December is going to be insane. We still have an out of town wedding to go to (hotel for 2 nights) and a wedding gift to give sister. Can't believe my wife spent $117 on the wedding survival kit for sister and her fiance

   
   
 
- Tomorrow night is my soon to be brother-in-law's bachelor party. From what I've heard it sounds like it will be the party of the decade. Steak dinner then a Limo Bus to a kickass stripclub. Really want to go but I'd have to take off work (-75), then I'd have a hard time not spending at least 100-150. So, I'm not going and will work instead. 
The number is completely relevant. If you had (properly) applied for 60 jobs and not got one, people would be more sympathetic, because you'd obviously have done the legwork. But as it is, it's quite clear that you've perhaps applied for one or two, if any, and are now qq'ing about "deary me, I still don't have a job...

This is exactly what my wife is going to say when I get another job and am working 50+ hours a week and won't be able to take off for holidays. She's said 20 times in the past few months how "it's just a lovely [blank] job and not that important" referring to my delivery job when I wanted to pick up an extra shift (I still haven't worked a Wednesday night shift), or the few times they called me in on an off day, she throws a huge fit and makes it tough on me because I hate her being mad at me. I'm done feeling like that though. No matter what kind of 2nd job I get even if it's a goddamn janitor job I'm working my rear end off.
So (we ask again) How did the Big Talk with her go? Did you ever actually have it?
yeah it just led to arguments and not much being accomplished. she was surprised by the amount of student loans. she thinks I keep discussing the budget and how much we spend to try to keep her from buying a car (which she still wants to do "soon") and says looking over the finances for hours is a waste of time because we just need to make more money. I forget what else was said, it was a while ago.
Wife bought pizza ($22) tonight. Yep. 
I didn't think we were using the cards much at all anymore. Grocery store, "entertainment", her pizza tonight, all purchased with cash. I checked all our credit cards and these are our purchases (2) for November so far:
online stuff 27.02 (this was 3 days ago and I have no idea what she bought, it's from some online place)
wedding gift 117.05 (discussed a couple pages ago)

A) Flipping burgers would be in addition to your pizza boy job, not instead of it.
B) If for some reason you think you're too good to flip burgers, feel free to get a better job. If you can. If you can't, maybe it's time to reevaluate your opinion of yourself.
Yup that is a problem. We have 6k in online savings account that doesn't get touched. Then the rest of our cash is split between checking account which is only used for paying bills (never use ATM card), and cash that gets used for whatever. Ok so what we need to do is put 1k in the "emergency stash" and never touch that unless it's an actual emergency. Then when there is an emergency and we take some out, we replenish it over the course of a couple months or whatever it takes to do it while not going over budget - ideally right? The rest we have over that 1k should be deposited and used to pay bills.
148,000 -&gt; 73,000 (what the christ?)
But if you'd like to know the plan anyway, we'd sell and use the "profit" to pay off debt. Then rent a place for less than what we're paying now, which is a fixed $1062 (mortgage 734, hoa 290, home owners ins 38) not counting home repairs and such. Also subtract whatever water would cost in the new place as HOA currently covers that. We did toss around the idea of moving back in with parents.

agreed. the only way we'd sell now is if we sold for a good 25-40k more than we owe on it (97k), which isn't happening now.

Well we realized a HUGE miscalculation and I deserve to get ripped a new one for this. Last semester the wife had a new student loan issued to cover the last few courses... well what happened was the loan was more than the courses cost during that one session, so instead of automatically applying it to the next semester (in the middle of it now) they refunded the difference to our checking account. $2588. I knew about this when it happened but didn't realize I was including that amount into the "ccdebt / cash" updates, when we just planned on keeping that amount to use for this semester's tuition. As you probably already guessed part of that 2588 was used to pay bills. 
And for another twist. I swear this is not a troll this really happened tonight. Wife said "remember months ago when I told you I had stashed 1k?" (Yeah she saved up 1000 over the course of a long time and kept it hidden from me, I forget for what reason, maybe a new car fund). Anyway I said "yeah we deposited that". She didn't think we did and so she looked and found it in the hiding spot. 
11/26/09: cdebt 11057, cash 9186 - 1588 (the amount left from the loan refund, already paid 1000 for tuition, the last 1588 will also go towards tuition) = 7580.
Not a package delivery driver (to end-customers). You just need to take a DOT physical exam and be able to drive a manual in most areas. You only need a CDL to operate a tractor trailer, which is actually a great career if you don't mind being on the road.
A worthy suggestion, but what is the best way (time spent vs money made per DVD) to sell that many DVDs? Do rental stores actually buy them?
Good to hear you finally had the conversation with your wife. After your "discoveries", does she still feel you are a "5"? And if does think you guys are 5, what are HER goals? Is she happy always being a 5? Does she want the two of you to be a 7? Can you use her goals to kind of sneakily get you from a -1 to a 3 (as she thinks you move from 5 to 8?) 
   
   

I always wanted one of those Logitech Harmony's but it has always seemed like a little too far out there as an unnecessary expense. I got this one a year ago for the bedroom, much cheaper (~$15) than the Logitech's and works great: 
Also, did you know there are free fantasy football leagues out there where you pay for fun and don't risk any money? My brother (who has a 1 year old daughter) loves competing with his friends for points and has a great time while still being able to feed, clothe, and house his child.
Thanks MK for taking the heat off me for a few minutes while I pack up a bag for Tampa tomorrow (football). Last game of the year.
I got the hotel rate reduced from 67 to 48 for the night (24 bucks from me)

I've been getting poo poo on but I deserve it and knew I would to some extent when I created this thread. Perhaps there are some elitists but the majority I'd guess are just like you and I (they go to football games, spend money, and drink 3 Miller Lite's at once) but they have and apply financial common sense.

Minimum Debt Repayments = 590 (credit cards 240, student loans 350)
Without seriously cutting back (something the past 4 months and 30 pages of this thread is evidence that we won't... at least nowhere near enough) we will eventually go into bankruptcy with a 3800/mo income with the current amount of debt we have.
Misc 412 (Now put in Personal categories)
Misc 314 (personal categories)
- pay minimum payments on the Amex (about $165)
$2,823 in total payments. Reduces cash available to $4,656. You could pay off a chunk of the Amex, but you guys are so retarded you will need cash on hand. Use the amount budgeted for payments to the other cards (HAHAHA budget) to go towards the Amex.
I like your plan even if it's not optimal as far as lessening interest charges (paying off the 0% card now). Getting everything down to 1 card would be badass. It will be difficult to convince wife to dip into the 6k ING though as we agreed not to touch that a while back. 
you all have convinced me to pay off the 2 cards, leaving only the amex to pay off month by month. have to wait until I hear about this new card I applied for (FOR A 0% RATE AND $0 TRANSFER FEE)

8/24 sunpass (road tolls) 10.00
Checked with Dept of Education regarding the incorrect date for the start of repayment of the student loans. They said to have school fax them verification of wife's enrollment and the grace period will be corrected (moved from 12/20/2009 to 6/20/2010).
2.73 * $186.16 = $508.22 (since all the loans have similar rates and most likely will have similar default repayment terms, I figure this is a good rough estimate for how much the servicers will ask for per month WITHOUT us consolidating)
I was there during the interview (sales pitch) from DeVry and I wanted to wait on signing up because I hadn't fully researched it and the costs yet. They were trying to get me to join too. Wife wanted to jump on it because she was all motivated to "finish her degree". See years ago she took quite a few classes at the local university here and thought most of that would transfer over. Guess how much ended up transferring? 1 course. Makes sense too that DeVry wouldn't transfer much, how else are they going to make money.
They require a minimum amount of credit hours per session to get financial aid and due to prerequisite requirements she ended up taking some courses that did not go towards the Accounting Associates program (went towards the 4-year Business Management program). That accounted for a good chunk of the difference and your 25k figure is a bit off. 
1. Zaurg is a troll with too much time on his hands. (In a way, I hope this is true. His debt is terrible.)
   
   
 
He either hasn't "brought it up yet" since a) the stars weren't aligned b) they weren't home at the same time c) she was too tired from working two jobs to discuss using their savings with her pizza boy husband
One big problem I've always had is lack of self motivation. I could climb Everest if I had a partner working along with me. I want to get in shape and run a few miles every day but I do it for 2 weeks then stop because something else gets in the way and I find excuses not to do it... but if I had someone pushing me I'd be a drat triathlon expert. What I'm saying is if one of you replaced my wife (as a new wife or some kind of gay life partner) I'd probably make a lot of progress

Both I'd consider middle class. Both parents divorced around 3 years old and very difficult custody battles with lots of fighting for a couple years after that. Neither of us were ever in a poor situation as far as I can recall... always got what we needed, but certainly weren't in that group (large group around here in South FL) that had every latest cool thing, new car when they were 16, etc. Both of us started working at 16 until we could pay cash for our first car.
This might not be a bad idea. I wonder which parent to pick. I mean they have to know we're struggling a bit since I've been delivering pizza for a little while and just took on a second job (but they may just think "oh we struggled early on with 3/4 kids and made it just fine"), but I'm sure they don't know the full extent of the fuckedupness.

This new "second" job is turning out to be a replacement job, not a second job. 2pm-7pm cuts into lunch shift and night shift for pizza delivery. I'll only be able to work pizza Sundays while working at this shipping company. But I am keeping my pizza shifts so when this shipping company job is done I can grab my old 5 days a week pizza shifts if I want. It would have been perfect if I had a night shift stocking job (8pm-1am, something like that) right now but I haven't found one yet.
Seriously dude that took two minutes of googling. Just go to traffic school (if you can budget that in lawl) and be done with it. No hit to insurance, no points.
I have a budget. I haven't exceeded it in 4 months. I have an excel spreadsheet with my finances and I have myself budgeted as getting out of debt in September of next year (barring a higher paying job or car problems)

How was working for hostdime/surpass? I think I know who you are because I worked through a 3rd party with them <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" title=";)"/>
Holy gently caress your resume sucks man. Either tonight (it's friday morning where I am currently) or over the weekend I will gut yours and revamp it for you - you can take it or leave it when I'm done. I'm currently doing mine for submittal by Monday, so you know what you get is what I'd be submitting myself. I'll explain how and why I'm doing what I do to it as well.
   
   

We looked around tonight (mainly under the pool table) and found enough gifts for 3 years of holidays. Seriously she stocked up on gifty type things over the past few years. Candles, christmas trinkets, stuff that says grandma and mom on them, personal engraved items that read "merry christmas from the [lastname]" on them. Yeah last year she had a case of custom made first aid kits or whatever they are. And pens that say the same thing. And shelves full of beauty products... but those need to be sold. Lots of this stuff needs to be sold.
 
If my wife wants something, she asks me first if its in the budget. If we can squeeze it in, she can have it, if not, then she can't. And that works both ways. It's worked for us for almost a year and while things might be tight (especially at the end of the month when we're trying to cut back on groceries so we could afford stuff earlier in the month) it's always worked because we both cooperated with each other. 
We don't do that yet, at least not all the time. Let's take the Wii for example. She still wants to get it and justifies it by saying she's getting a $100 gift card from her boss as a xmas bonus/gift, and $100 from her mom to go towards the Wii, so for a $200 Wii we would "only be paying the tax" (and I'd guess also whatever accessories are required). So our income *should* be 4000 this month, not 3800.

This is exactly what will happen. That and what freakin time do we have to be playing Wii. She wanted the Wii fit for me to get me to lose a couple pounds (5'11", 185lbs, I really should drop about 15). But this job#2 is doing that so bam... no need.

Are you suggesting I move and rebuild the pool table for the buyer? What happens when the thing is way off/unlevel when my amateur rear end rebuilds it? Seriously that sounds like a horrible idea. I have no problem with manual labor but I have a problem with spending hours upon hours of manual labor with the hopes 1) the table will sell and 2) I can actually move and rebuild the thing myself. 
Holy gently caress your resume sucks man. Either tonight (it's friday morning where I am currently) or over the weekend I will gut yours and revamp it for you - you can take it or leave it when I'm done. I'm currently doing mine for submittal by Monday, so you know what you get is what I'd be submitting myself. I'll explain how and why I'm doing what I do to it as well.
I got the job today (pending criminal background check). Easiest interview I've ever had in my life. Full time position and there is opportunity for lots of overtime. $14/hour so this is a good step up in the right direction. Next big thing to figure out is daycare. We may still be able to get by with wife watching her at work for a few hours combined with grandmas helping out. We've had offers from friends for 1 to 2 days a week too. One of them wants to do some kind of babysitting "point system" with her 1 year old son, i.e., she babysits our daughter one day, we get her son Friday night when she goes out or something.
Also my mom asked what we wanted (by the way is this normal? parents asking what we (30+ year old married couple) want for Christmas?). Going to tell her tomorrow we're getting a Wii so how about cash to put towards accessories.
Things look better because I got the job, football season is over, and little changes are going into effect. Like cell phone bill dropped to $108 this month. Dental insurance we were paying an outrageous $53/month and the plans I've been looking at for the wife are in the $10-15/month range (me and daughter are covered already). Also the amount spent on gas has gone down a lot since I'm not delivering pizza as much.

I don't understand the purpose of this. We already agreed 100% of what I get will go towards paying off the cards and the wife's paycheck will pay the bills. Since we already still have the 6k in savings (ING) what's the point of putting money into savings and taking money out (the 6k) at the same time? 
12/1/09	Baby	formula	$39.18 (will be $24.18 once I get the $15 rebate)
Instead of SWITCHING CARS so his wife can see lifting is hard with a 4 door too, she's already printing out pictures of $50,000 cars (probably).
Oh, and I don't trust those amounts above either. I bet it was $35.99 plus tax ($38.33). This is sad.
 - you should take a break from worrying about the money. Let her have the Wii (but not the car), and 
Why? Because pushing things right now will be counterproductive. As a fully-qualified Internet Psychologist, it's become pretty clear that the issue is no longer soley about finance, if it ever was. She's not stupid, and some part of her understands the trouble they're in - else why would she get a second job when she's got a little baby at home? I think she's scared and under a lot of stress due to being a new mother and it's the holidays (always stressful) AND now she's being told how bad things are by a guy who, no insult intended, she's been carrying financially for months and even got a second job for. Is it any wonder she might be deep in denial?. Most normal people react badly (at least at first) when things go wrong - some withdraw and become apathetic, some get angry and blame others, and some deny that there's even a problem in the first place. Given your posts, I suspect your wife is in the latter category.
So...let it alone for a while. Give in on the small stuff (the Wii is small stuff, compared to the big picture). Make some good memories of your kid's first Christmas and New Year's - you don't want to remember it as being nothing but acrimony and sullen arguments, do you? Take up the subject again next year, when she's less stressed and more amenable to reason. I think pushing too hard now will only make her ball up tighter.
   
   

Including nagging about the amount of laundry detergent she uses in each load. That poo poo is expensive and it seems to me like she goes through it way too fast. One big jug is supposed to last over 100 loads and I'm buying it too often. She just fills that cup to the top and ignores the 1.. 2.. 3.. lines they have there, because the 2 level (large load) "doesn't make the clothes smell fresh enough". 
1) Took previous advice and downgraded cell phone plan from 1400 min/month to the 700 mins/month plan last month. We stayed under 700, using 622 minutes, so we throttled our phone usage well. old plan 132.17, new plan 108.44 = saving $23.73/month. I think I can shave another 5 or 10 bucks off per month by downgrading the text plan (currently paying $10 per phone for 400 txt for each phone, last month we only did a combined 207 txt msgs)
2) Both of us need to change our mindsets with these kinds of things. This morning before wife left for work she said hey we have a 20% off coupon for BedBath&amp;Beyond;, my shower curtain has some mold, I need a new one. I just spent 10 minutes cleaning it and it looks brand new. Maybe that was her way of getting me to clean her shower, but whatever, that's 1 unneeded purchase avoided.
3) Cancelled Rivals message board membership. They wouldn't give me a prorated refund but at least it won't renew now in Februrary. Saves $99.95 for the year.
 
Thanks for the tip. Will be a while... for some reason they put our phones in seperate contracts and they end on (mine) 9/3/2010 and (hers) 7/8/2011.

I understand why you're nitpicking about this, I really do. I'm the same way. I have a spreadsheet detailing the past 12 months of cell phone usage and the contract details. I hate it when my wife (or anyone for that matter) skims past the details, like when signing up for something, or paying a bill, I have to review it completely to know what the hell I'm paying for. Until shortly after we got married I never saw one of her credit card statements, then I started looking and what the hell... so many random charges for poo poo she didn't need, like those credit card balance coverage programs that charge $5-10 a month, I think she had 3 of those things and just blindly kept paying for them because she thought she needed them. This is all detailed in my spreadsheet called CapitalOneShit.xls - here's an excerpt:
PlanPlus 800-591-9177	7/10/2008 $(8.25)	
Payment Protection 888-527-6904	7/15/2008 $(0.07)	
Yeah I got a copy of Ramsey's "Financial Peace University". Listened to about half of part 1 (Super Savers) today in the car and wow this is good stuff. So much of the stuff he's talking about is us EXACTLY. It's scary. Before I listen to any more I'm going to switch it up to listening to it with the wife. I'm going to suggest we listen to it at night around dinner time instead of watching TV for an hour like we usually do. We should be able to get 1 section done per night. I hope she'll be receptive to it.
Received $25 gift from pizza job when I went in to tell them I would only be working Sundays now that I got a full-time job. Printed them some new schedules and got drivers to takeover my shifts. While there I picked up tomorrow night's (Saturday) shift.
Have to start repaying in June. She finished her last class 2 days ago (HORRAY!!!), so a 6 month grace period would be June.

$4500 @ 0% = $409 payment (409 if we want to get it to 0 before 0% ends in Nov 2010)
$1187 @ 0% = $148 payment (148 if we want to get it to 0 before 0% ends in Aug 2010)
1 jared (yes, I went to jared)
I don't think I've ever had an annual fee on a credit card in my life. I actually didn't think any credit cards had them outside of AmEx and Discover (of which I have neither). Is it all from those?
Your credit score is 742 (350 to 850 scale)
(Quizzle gives you a score which is based on your credit report from Experian, one of the three major credit bureaus. The scale is 350 (minimum) to 850 (maximum).)
Your home value is $122,350 (eh, not really)
2010 is the year poo poo gets turned around. Had a good talk with the wife last night while we were baking treats till 1am. Yes, I enjoy baking and eating various mixes of flour, sugar, butter, chocolate, and nuts. I couldn't resist chatting with her about what we'd talk about during the "family meeting". The biggest thing I grabbed from Ramsey so far is no matter what we do... there has to be a plan. Yes there are unexpected events, but have a plan to be able to handle them. We shouldn't buy a car next week, but make a plan now to buy one in a year. Etc. Etc. I'm going to be spending quite a bit of time writing out everything I'd like to go over in the meeting - that's the only way we'll accomplish anything. I'll have an entire outline with bullet points and printouts of 2009's monthly expenses (down to the penny as you've seen). 
Communication breakdown lately regarding everything. She's set on buying a car and says I won't listen to her (about her reasons for buying a car now) and I say she won't listen to me (about my reasons for not buying a car now). Tonight I said I know your reasons exactly for wanting to buy a new car now and named them in detail to her. Told her I previously countered those reasons and anyway we pretty much are in some kind of gridlock and she said tonight "this isn't going to end well and whatever happens its going to be bad".
Zaurg, how is your relationship with your inlaws? Are her parents the type that will line up behind her automatically, or are they the type that may support you if you talk to them and expose your finances for what they are? You may have powerful allies there, and at this point sitting down with them with all the cards on the table (relationship and financial), and asking for their advice and input (and then listening to it!) is almost certainly a good thing.
Not sure about mother-in-law, because its her mother (grandma-in-law) who offered to buy my wife's car for $4500 (keep in mind I've only ever heard that from my wife, not from mother-in-law or grandma). My point is I think my wife is getting asked frequently "so when are you getting the new car / selling the car to grandma?" kind of thing. As I typed this out I get the feeling my wife told her months ago we are definitely buying a new car and her grandma is probably anxious to buy her Civic! Christ this makes more sense now. 
- Windshield replacement. I believe Progressive will (has to?) do this for free.
Sure, except you guys will pay it off with this huge chunk of money (+ money from savings since your refund isn't going to be that much most likely) and then you'll just rack up your debt again because you guys have yet to be able to stick to your budget for even one month since you started this thread about 6 months ago.
Your wife is hoping a debt fairy will appear and wipe out her debt, and her life can continue on unchanged (or even better yet, NEW and IMPROVED)
1) Your number 1 danger is wifey will go out and get herself her new car. It is not going to be a $350 payment, she and her dad and her mom are going to go out and she is going to buy a loving Jetta because women always buy loving Jettas and they always think they got a great deal on it. So that's more like $600 a month. Or maybe $300 a month if she leases it in which case I don't even know what to say, you're going to be totally hosed in three years.
2) Then she sells the Civic to Grandma and poof, now you guys have $10K in the bank! You're really doing well at saving this year!
3) Which means she can buy a really nice carseat for her new car. And this totally sweet stroller that clips into it! ($500) 
4) Time to buy insurance! Since it's a new car and it's on a loan (or lease) it's going to have to be full coverage. Another $200 a month!
Well, like he said not including credit cards, in October we were $570 over budget and that includes a $744 payment for the last of the pregnancy charges (epidural).
She said she's not opposed to a used car but prefers a new CR-V. When we test drove them months ago the lower model (LX? I forget) was just fine for her.
If you're going for counseling, see if you can screen the counselor by yourself first (quick 15 minute meeting or something). There are a lot of kooks out there, not a lot of qualifications necessary to set yourself up as 'marriage counselor', and you don't want to end up with someone who doesn't understand finance themselves and thinks the root of problem resolution is just to compromise everything. Or worse, some man-hater who will torch you at the stake. Fun times.
she said that before she got pregnant the first time (beginning of 2008), she said we needed a new car before having a child. so that was a while ago and thinks she has waited long enough. Yes I've been fighting her on this for a while. You know what's crazy is if in Jan 2008 we decided like a rational normal married couple "hey we need a new car, let's save for it" and put away $200 a month for it we'd have $4800 now to go towards a car.

   
   

I handled the bill paying from 2003-2008. During that time I think we had it setup where she paid 2 bills (cell phone and electric) and I paid the rest. In 2008 we switched it up where she is handling paying the bills and she keeps a check register. But either way since we've been married bills are paid from our joint checking account.
I feel like this is a Pizza Delivery Boys Anonymous (PDBA) meeting 
Good news! Got 3 paychecks today (2 from job#2 and first one from job#3). Cha-ching!
#1 goal is getting cc debt to 0. I can't figure out my wife's math (because she doesn't use math when making these goals/decisions, at least not on paper) but she thinks we'll be able to get it done by March, 2010. My goal was to get it done before her student loan repayments start in August.
Before you can even talk about how awesome it is that you're going to pay down your debt, you need to loving MAKE IT ONE MONTH WHERE YOU'VE EARNED MORE THAN YOU'VE SPENT (this does NOT include things like tax returns). Until you can do this for one month (and the next, and the next, and every month after that FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE) you're deluding yourself.
And again to touch on the "we can't borrow money" topic, I'm thinking now more about what we could handle without having to consolidate all her student loans. Obviously the total of all the minimum payments would be the important number to look at, but if we could handle them, and apply the Debt Snowball process to them to get them paid off quicker (much quicker than $340/month for 25 years)

CCAMEX 150 (will apply 100% of tax refund to this card)
CCUSBank 450 (450 per month will get it to 0 before interest begins)
CCVisa 170 (170 per month will get it to 0 before interest begins)
StudentLoans 0 (starts August 2010 at 340/month)
Emergency 0 (will start rebuilding to cover 3 full months after cc debt is 0)
FLPrepaid 0 (begins in april at 35/month)
Retirement 0 (will start recontributing to this after ccdebt is gone and emergency fund is full)
Housing 1025 (combined mortgage and hoa)
InsuranceHealth 325 (raised from 320 to properly cover dental ins for wife)
Internet 48 (raised from 28. will be calling AT&amp;T; to negotiate a lower price)
Phone 107 (raised from 100)
Electric 93 (this will normally be in the 115-145 range, Jan is low because they issued a credit)
Grocery 400 (raised from 350. to make things easier to track I'm going to include the old "HouseholdStuff" in this category. This would be things like a pack of A/C filters from Home Depot. Or a new $50 deadbolt lock for the front door because it broke.)
AutoGas 150 (raised from 120. 120 was way too low)
Lunches 85 (I think this is too high and I think we'll be a decent amount under this. I'm brown bagging every day and wife buys lunch about once a week)
Blow 200 (includes all personal and group entertainment)
MedicalCopays 500 (child 3*45 me 1*35,2*65 wife 2*35,2*65)
I thought about how to handle this "annual fund" idea. Obviously we're just starting it now by putting aside $287 every month to cover all of these items for the year... the problem is we'll have the first big item (auto insurance) due in February which will be around $650. We won't have enough in the fund yet to cover that. So the plan is, to make it simple and easy to facilitate is to take $3445 from emergency 6k account to build the annual fund NOW. Put it in an easily accessible account like a money market and dedicate that account as our Annual Expenses account. Then this year we'll replenish it by $287 each month and by January 2011, we'll have a full annual fund to use again. So we'll always been a year ahead and always be putting in that $287 per month to build it. Then of course when cc debt is 0, we rebuild the emergency account to cover 3 months expenses which will be around 10k.
 sick to freaked-out new parents). Also they don't need new clothing either - which actually doesn't have to be new but who are we kidding, the wife would never dream of buying anything used.
High month (March) 2668
Wife did not help come up with the whole budget. I'm going to force it on her until agrees it is a necessity or until she leaves. She can't very well divorce me on grounds that I was trying to help the family by setting up a budget can she? (Yes we still have tons of problems and had a big fight last night, got into it about the car again)
To me it seems the first way (flexible) is much easier and that's what I'm looking for. Ease of use for this budget. Keep in mind this is all tracked in Excel so it's easier for that too. And if every month we're forced to sit down for a bit and decide what auto maintenance is needed that month it may end up being healthier for our cars too.
Wife wanted 2. Visa and MC. She has this weird close relationship with her credit cards, just like Ramsey says. That first one especially. We don't even loving use the card (Capital One Mastercard), it has a high interest rate, and a $59 annual fee, and she's adamant about keeping it because it's the first card and her only mastercard.

   
   

Yeah I'm going to propose that. So the thing is if she saves $300 (or whatever the monthly amount is the calculator says) for 6 months = $1800... I have to agree to the brand spanking new $24k Honda CR-V. No thank you maybe I can talk her down to a couple years old car for like $15k or whatever they go for. Either way I don't like it. I love my 17 year old rusty Saturn.
  It's a savings account but you open up an account for a specific goal and it will keep a pretty little chart as to what percentage of that goal you've reached. A direct deposit is made each month of at least $25 in to your account and you can also make one time deposits. It's also social so if you want, your friends and family can add money to it (if they happen to be supportive of you guys saving for a car). 
The cute graphs will be nice, the part I will have trouble with is convincing ZWife Smarty Pig is trustworthy/secure. Took me a while to convince her ING was a good idea (back when savings account was ~5%).

We've been over budget a lot longer than the past 6 months. Even the one month we weren't over budget (actually we were) was ridiculous. March 2009, "income" was 7k, 3k of that was from tax refund. Well we spent $6900. 
oh yes I've showed her. She says well CC debt has gone down, we haven't missed any payments, and we just weren't making enough money. Technically she's right about not making enough money... IF we didn't make enough lifestyle changes compared to before I lost my last job. For example in the first 6 months of 2008 we brought in 40.4k (includes 3.3k tax refund), expenses were 31.5k, and 1.8k went to retirement... so we were making more than we spent but drat if we weren't saving anywhere near as much as we should have.

Was $47.95 per month. Now $42.95 per month for 12 months and I get a $50 visa gift card (to be used *ONLY* at grocery store)
Thanks for the idea about getting gift cards with the skymiles. It looks like I can get a lot more value that way compared to buying actual tickets. They now charge 40,000 miles for a roundtrip ticket in the US, per ticket! And this is for a $175 flight * 2 = $350 (plus you still have to pay at least $20 in fees on top of that)
For us, each round trip ticket cost $255.40 (including tax) so we could either use 25,000 miles and pay $5.40 extra or we could use $30,000 miles and pay for the whole thing with miles (we opted for option #1 and are out of pocket $10 instead of $510 and used 50,000 miles for 2 tickets).
- A couple cards for Olive Garden or Outback, so when we (wife) do get a hankering for going out, there we go, no need to use cash.
1) Do you have a budget?
2) Has your wife agreed to follow the budget?
3) Is the budget realistic, does it account for your expenses/needs, and are you actually following it to determine whether you should buy something or not?
4) Does the budget still work out when you need to start paying off your student loans?
5) Does the budget allow you to do things you absolutely need to do like pay for your kids' education and put money away for retirement?
Can I get back to you in a few months? Season tickets are out of the question, but maybe I could go to just 2 or 3 games (FSU, VTech, and UNC at home this year). Let's at least wait until the tickets are for sale, we know the amount, we know our income vs expenses vs debt status, and maybe I can do a Suzy Orman-style question to BFC at that time.
 a year. If you're getting color, you have to maintain it every couple of months (sometimes more depending on the shade.) Anyway, your wife doesn't sound like the kind of person who would skimp on doing single haircuts for a year while spending money on invitation chocolates and Wonderhangers.
   
   

Looks good, Zaurg. And there's nothing wrong with going to a few football games, at all but you should start thinking about it NOW so that you put a certain amount of your own "Blow" money away each month so you can afford them. That way if all the good games are in the same month or you have to purchase them all in the same month, you can still fit them in to your lifestyle comfortably (Assuming $100 isn't enough for 3 good games). 
Looks like you're doing well, which is good. Just make sure doing well for a month or even a few months doesn't equal an increase in cost living for you guys (aka: new cars, etc.). You're doing well because you had a drastic increase in income and right now, you guys are mostly living your old lifestyle but with a little more frugality. Make sure you stick with this until the debt is gone and then re-assess (for savings, retirement, increased personal accounts). 
Also, debt IS an expense. You bought stuff on credit at a previous time, deferring the "expense" at that time until a later date. Eventually, it will (hopefully) be gone, but it is still an expense right now.
It wasn't meant to be smug. I just get excited about this stuff (baby step 2 - debt snowball) lately. I have a Dave Ramsey CD in my car and I'm halfway through listening to it for the second time.

Grocery we're on pace to spend $422.53 (259/19=13.63, 13.63*31=422.53). I think we're doing ok and I think we'll be able to keep it under 400.
VV "Less complicated" The idea is that you set up your money to route where it needs to go, then you are (guilt-)free to spend the remaining amount you have budgeted.
Add in paying off the student loans at an accelerated rate and that $1800 is effectively spoken for. Don't get it into your or (especially) your wife's head that the $1800 becomes spending money! If you do, you're going to have a battle when the cards are paid off and then you say that the new car was just a hypothetical and you really are going to use that money for savings/school debt.
The following discount(s) are listed on this policy:
Then why does it take so long when people ask you for things like your December and January numbers (you never posted December by the way, not that it really matters)? Shouldn't it just be right there in your spreadsheet already?
I posted the CC payments in one post and the budget containing only "expenses" (not debt) in another post. Then I combined them to make it easier for you to follow. I'll try to keep everything nicely together and easy to follow for you in the future, sir.

Meh. I try not to look at it like that. I look at that and say drat if we don't really fix this poo poo we'll end up like that. I could say "well at least we're not as bad as so and so" a lot and that doesn't help. For example my wife brought this up about a friend of hers, married, 3 kids, they don't even have a bank account, live paycheck to paycheck (when they have jobs), months behind on their bills - and they've been that way their entire life. When getting their tax return they go to one of those rapid refund places and get a check in 1 day but probably pay outrageous fees just to get it quick.

$284 speeding ticket wasn't budgeted for (lol) - I put that in PersonalHusband.
***Note, payments to credit cards aren't even included above. When I include the budgeted payments to credit cards (which I should, thank you clockworx) we get this...
12/2/09	PersonalHusband	target clothes	$63.85 (part of this was a pair of boots for stupid UPS job. wore them a couple times until they almost broke my foot)
12/8/09	PersonalHusband	shoes	$58.55 (bought new shoes because the "boots" sucked so like I said before I spent almost $100 on shoes for the UPS job)
12/16/09	Gifts	lenox gift $35.00 (this was that gift for child wife bought, I never got it returned)
Yup December was a gently caress up. When knew in March 2009 when the wedding was going to be and could have saved properly for it. OR, we could have NOT splurged and not drank and drove home at night instead of staying at the hotel (about 1 hour drive) but drat who wants to do that? 
- That was 100% wife. We're talking cheap plates here (dollar store) to give away with cookies on them.

   
   
 
- Back to the wedding weekend. 3*150=450(hotel), plus about 30 in taxes IIRC. 480+100(gift)=580. 580+20(gas)=600. 
BUT, occasionally I tire of that process and just go along with whatever the wife already purchased (like the wedding hotel). So, sometimes I'm lazy.

Savings account (6k) hasn't been touched. 
Your student loan debt does not magic itself away if you retire. Similarly, you can snowball the student debt and then save -more- towards retirement than you would otherwise if you left the loans around, thank to a) freeing that money up, and b) less interest.
ok I hear you, thanks. But mutual funds (retirement savings), over the course of ~35 years, can't average better than 6.8%?

Your student loan interest rates seem really high. Do you know what rate you could consolidate them at? I was able to consolidate mine (7-8 years ago) at 3.25%, and interest rates were higher then than they are now. 
Thanks for the helpful reply. I have enough idiots trolling (at least they could try to be funny instead of rehashing the same thing over and over right?). I'd no clue we could reconsolidate that low. The standard stafford rate was in the 5-6.8% range when all these loans were issued from 2006-2009, so I'd be surprised to see it lowered that much if consolidated. But either way, I will definitely check on that.

Your student loan interest rates seem really high. Do you know what rate you could consolidate them at? I was able to consolidate mine (7-8 years ago) at 3.25%, and interest rates were higher then than they are now. 
The reason your student loans were so low is because rates used to be 91 day Treasury bill + x% variable rate. If you consolidated these old loans when rates were low, you could lock the low rates in. However, starting on July 1, 2006 rates on new loans went from variable to fixed. Congress did this to help students out by guaranteeing them a fair rate on the loans, but they couldn't anticipate the super low interest rate environment that we now find ourselves in (which would have made variable rate loans a steal). 
Do you have a job where you can leave for 2.5 hours while no one covers you, when your boss (the one who would normally cover you) made an unexpected meeting when you were supposed to be leaving? If so that's cool, someday I hope I have a job with that kind of flexibility and freedom. My wife doesn't.

This guy wins the award for most positive attitude. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" title=":)"/>
It'll happen. Hell it's already paid for (the initial evaluation), it's going to happen.

   
   
 
drat why is there such a huge difference in the auto insurance quotes ($318/year) I'm getting depending on what my *current* coverage is? I'm getting penalized a lot because I currently have crappy 10/20/25 coverage. I guess the insurance companies figure I'm more of a risk when moving up? Even if I've never filed a claim? 
That's actually a decent idea. I already talked to her about buying a car with saved up cash when I pointed out how much in our budget now is going to CC debt (about $1800/month), how quickly we could save up and buy a car with cash, no need for a loan. So, $900 to student loans, $900 for car fund, we'd have $10.8k after a year. That doesn't factor in the need to start throwing money into retirement savings.

Putting $1800 to cc debt a month, income tax refund (estimating it to be in the 3-4k range) = paying off 8k of cc debt soon.(USER WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THIS POST)
I think he posted before that the joint amount is for when the two of them (or three of them) go out together, for dinner and stuff, so they don't have to do silly things like split the bill. Makes sense to me; my wife and I do the same thing.
This is correct. The DirecTV bill goes into the Entertainment category, so $55 out of that $100 is automatically gone. Before I had TV as a separate category. In January the Entertainment category consisted of TV ($55), one night picked up food ($15), and we went out to dinner for our anniversary ($60).

We were using paper plates and paper towels. Everything else used was real (cups, bowls, utensils). 
True. Not sure who the home opener is but the ticket face value would be anywhere from $28 to $55 depending on the opponent. So yeah I can agree on that. Sell that ticket (or just not buy it, since I haven't purchased any tickets yet).
2) You're still psycho on the buckets which is totally unnecessary. The gifts poo poo should go into the category for who spent the money. There is no need for a 'Gifts' or 'Charity' category. 
Good idea, thanks. In the past we always gave cash but the Church records it (if we put it in their envelope) and sends us a statement at the end of the year.
Damnit! You're right, I hadn't looked at it like that. To be honest I hadn't given the rollover stuff a lot of thought. The idea was that we each have a Blow envelope. So at the end of January I had $75 left and wife had $21 left. But if we actually roll that over technically we'd be over budget by $82 (3082 + 75 + 21 = 3178 then 3178 - 3096 = 82). So this rollover plan doesn't work if we're overbudget in a couple other categories every month. Now I'm confused... this is getting too complicated.
1/15/10	Blow	cake&amp;chips;	33.75 (wife bought a cake and chips for friend's bday party)
1/21/10	Blow	dinner	60.00 (anniversary dinner)
1/29/10	Blow	night out	25.00 (wife night out with friends. first night out in ~2 years, I was happy she went out)
Overall, I do think this is sustainable, though I do see some areas that might pop up and bite our budget at times. Like my daughter's doctor bills. The insurance and actual charges from the doctor are difficult for me to figure out. Just last week the doctor sent us a bill for $452 for charges back in August and October and this is the first bill they've sent regarding it... pretty weird... since we always pay a copay amount at the office. I called them and gave them our insurance info (AGAIN) so they should be able to submit the claim . Anyway just reading the doctor invoices and insurance coverage is cryptic as hell and it shouldn't be. I just need to sit down, go over the coverage and make some calls to the doctor to get charges for future planned visits and figure out a close estimate cost for the year. Other than that area and properly rolling over some "Blow" savings to cover &gt;$100 purchases later in the year, I don't see any problems being able to sustain this.

   
   
 
50/100/50 liability with uninsured and underinsured (non-stacked)
If we go with this same policy with our current company (Progressive), it is $884 for 6 months.
Under 58k!!! (Has a lot less motivating effect)
Have you figured out how much of a tax refund you are getting? (if any)
Wife wants to use that and what she gets from selling her car ($4-5k) towards a down payment on a new car. I don't. Anyone have suggestions for a compromise?

I think the best compromise is to sell the Civic to grandma ($4k), then buy something in this range:
3) Get her a AAA membership, and the business card of a rental car company, and tell her she's covered if anything breaks down. Because those two things will pale in comparison to how much she'll blow on depreciation and interest of a "reliable" new car.
I know this is more of a financial forum, but when's the last time you took her out for a reasonable evening (dinner at a chain restaurant and a movie) and told her you love her? I mean, you obviously cared enough to marry her and have a child with her, you should re-establish your mutual love for each other and open the lines of communication. 
Notice I didn't say that you need to make her sit down and listen to you or vice-versa. You need a real conversation about your wants and needs (and it's important to separate the two), and then a real conversation about where you are currently, where you want to be, and how you're going to get there. Don't do this on date-night, and don't do it all at once. Ease into it. Listen to her, understand what she wants, and tell her what you want. Then figure out a plan 
If a brand new car is on her list, she'll have to realize that your (not hers, both of yours) credit card debt and student loans are going to cripple any chance at getting ahead. It's OK to make plans on how you're going to afford a new car if that's what you both agree is possible, but you have got to come up with a viable plan 
zaurg, I would like to know if anyone around you (friends, family, coworkers), especially the ones in contact with your wife, frequently buy gifts/new cars/pool tables/mlm crap? Are the people your age who you know doing a lot better than you are? Was she raised believing that this is how a normal family lives? 
- New cars, mostly no, but there is 1 in her family that came to mind. One of her cousins (who is local and wife is pretty close to) is close to 40 and in pretty bad debt as far as I know, and drives a leased BMW Z4.

Hmm you know I was just thinking about this again and it does *seem* like most people around us (sisters, both parents, cousins) just spend spend spend. Seems like they go out to eat so often, I have no idea how much her mom&amp;dad; spend on food per month. I don't know anyone else in family or close friends who actually has a written budget for personal finances. The last time it came up in discussion at her mom's house there were laughs because I'm that crazy spreadsheet guy (seriously it's a joke, because I have a spreadsheet for everything).
3. Never buy anything you do not understand – I guess this doesn’t really apply to a DVD player since most people won’t understand that – but are you sure you really (really) understand how that cash value life insurance plan works?
5. Seeking the counsel of your spouse (or financial accountability partner) – self explanatory (or at least it should be…if it’s not, you have some other things to work on as well!).
This is what I want. Imagining having no debt other than a mortgage that is no more than 20% of my income and a fully funded emergency fund (15k) would be so awesome. I could actually save for a vacation without that nagging feeling of credit card bills and stuff like that. I'd imagine the actual enjoyment of the vacation or football game or whatever would be so much better.
I'm thinking back to our couple little vacations... honeymoon... hardrock concert... etc and I recall really enjoying those times but still that nagging feeling in my brain that "we really can't afford this, we're going to be paying for this for the next couple of months" really limits having a great time (for me).

But you're right it wouldn't solve *the* problem. With that leftover 67k, wife would want to rent out our condo to her brother (horrible idea) and buy a new house which would almost double our mortgage payment. I'd convince her to fully fund some IRA's and throw the rest in long-term mutual fund savings or I'd die trying. Then save like mad... with our current budget and income level we could save $28k a year without a mortgage, student loans, and credit card debt. GODDAMN. Trust me I've had this daydream before

If you really think that's what your wife would agree to do, and not want to buy presents for all of her friends, upgrade your car (she can't have her husband driving around in a hoopty!), buy season tickets for you, your wife, and your friends, you are nuts.
   
   

Did this post blow anyone else's mind or was it just me? In the span of 10 seconds, he turned a $250,000 gift (which he could use to pay bills, loans and fill a college fund for his daughter...and oh yes!..a new car) into $67,000 minus a new mortgage and credit card debt. So basically he's right back to where he started!
= 72k (not sure how I got 67 before)
It's amazing the shift in thinking I've gone through during this thread (taken 6+ months I know). Even just a few months ago, and 6 years ago when I bought my condo, the thought process went "well I need to replace that sink/vanity in the guest bathroom, I'll just put it on the credit card and pay it off later". Or "existing carpet in room is gross and needs replacing, Home Depot time, hey I can get 0% credit on this here $1500 carpet" and that was after searching around at a couple different stores figuring out which carpet I wanted and which was the best price, etc. But I don't ever recall thinking "well I don't have $1500 cash set aside for this, I better save up for 3 months and deal with the current flooring until then". This example isn't exactly how it went down but is exactly the same scenario for a LOT of things over the past 6 years. I mean how did I get to point where "just slap it on the credit card, we'll pay it off later" became 100% completely acceptable and the normal thing to do? It seems completely absurd thinking about it now.
 
AND they now have a 6 month payment plan at no extra cost (0%)
To be honest, I think getting this is a bad idea because I'm almost certain you will underestimate 2), and end up paying interest due to 1), but depending on how dead set you are on this, at least you'll have a more accurate idea of what it really costs
- 41 football ticket+parking (Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul)
So, instead if I pay in full for the "good seat" ($246.50) it would go something like this (if it's the same way as prior years, I'll find out)
Sure, if you budget it properly then the season tickets are acceptable. However, your wife is going to see you buying football tickets while at the same time telling her she can't buy things she wants (car, gifts, hangers).
You are going to type out that you spend $25 on a game day with a straight face? You eat one decent meal and more than half of that is gone. Hell, five beers and there goes your 25$ without including gas expenses. So what I'm going to do is up that estimate to $40. That gets you a quarter tank of gas three beers and a decent meal (or two so so meals if you are so inclined). That estimate still isn't conservative by a financial definition. If I were to be conservative I would bring that to $50, but we'll leave it where it is right now.
*edit* ok I read the rest of your post. Not sure how you justify putting DirecTV into my football Blow expenses. Even with your calculations, 52% going to football is fine with me as long as I keep total blow expenses at 100% or less of that $1800 (without using credit cards as you noted). 
Here's what I'll do. Since I have a record of every penny I spent in 2009 (and 2008), I'll go back to see what would be classified as "Blow" expenses for myself and report back to BFC. That should provide a better estimate. I'm going to get raped by BFC for doing that because I bet it'll be over $1800 but oh well... it should allow me to get a very accurate estimate for 2010 because I know I'm not going to any away games like I did last November which was significantly more expensive.

Well, yes, one day or one month or whatever is still the past. I really think I have a completely different view of things financially than I did last year (yes, 42 days ago). I don't think I can explain it very well but that's how I feel. If you think that is foolish and pathetic then I doubt I can change your mind without proving it over the next months... years... whatever.

+20 processing fee (thought it was 10 before)
+50 parking (used to be $37.50 but now it's 50 because 1 person has been dropped from our group, so parking is split by 3 instead of 4 (parking pass is $150).)
- 45 football ticket+parking (Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul)
Also, didn't you guys decide NOT to go with the "Give $150 in cash at the beginning of the month to spend or save as you see fit" and instead go with the "Put into personal savings only the amount we are under budget (after calculation of ALL categories)" ? 
Last month you guys were overbudget in your other categories and it was not using all of your Blow money that made you guys break even. I ask because you may be looking at $104 in Blow Money in August and think "I'll carry some of that over to the next month and it will be fine" but the way you guys are currently dealing with your blow money may not allow for that if you're overbudget in your other areas (or if you wife is over budget in her blow area).
The only time we've EVER done something like this was last month we watched the "Lunch" bunch towards the last week because it was getting close (ended up using $51 out of $60).

I realize $13/mo is small fries here but when is that FL Prepaid bullshit going away, Zaurg? It's a recurring expense and it's too symbolic of your wife's "let's buy things fore everyone to show how rich we (pretend to be)" mentality.
I called FL Prepaid this morning and found out I can transfer the account to my sister and she can 1) continue contributing the $24.61 a month or 2) cancel and withdraw the full $1100 that's in the account now. I called my sister and said we've been contributing to this account now for about 4 years and would like to transfer it to her. She said she's going to talk to mom to find out if she would be able to continue contriubtions for her for a while so they can keep it open... so I'll find out what she wants to do later. 
Do you guys have any suggestions for my sister? If she continues contributing, It's $24.61 a month for the next ~13 years and that funds the account to a total of about $5100, which can be used to pay for a 2-year community college tuition in the year 2023. For those who don't know the FL Prepaid locks in tuition rates the year you open the account (2006 in this case). Dave Ramsey said this was dumb because he said return on mutual fund investments would be higher than college tuition inflation... but from what I've read lately I don't know if that's the case. Or my sister can take out the current lump sum of about $1100 and use that for bills or reinvest it somewhere else.

So the fact that I'm doing the FL Prepaid thing *now* (we've talked about canceling/transferring the account in the past) she's going to say "oh you're only doing that so you can fit football into your budget"....

So by May, you guys have $1750 MORE dollars to spend on yourself and your family. Obviously the student loans will be due soon, but that's nothing compared to what you're throwing at the cards right now. Even if you guys were ambitious and wanted to pay them off in 5 years ($1000/month), you guys would still have $750 MORE dollars to spend on your family each month. 
a) Put $1700 to loans, paid off in ~3 years
b) Put $1000 to loans, paid off in ~5 years, remaining $700 to emergency fund
c) Put minimum $350 to loans, remaining $1350 to emergency fund and childcare savings
and lots more options. drat I don't know, we'll figure it out. The thing with option (a) what if 2-3 years from now the loans are just about gone and wife and I completely hate each other and get separated I'm going to be "goddamn I just wasted the last 3 years working my rear end off to pay off her loans???" So, I'm more inclined to want to definitely pay more than minimum, but not put every last cent towards it. Am I a horrible person for thinking this?
   
   

Invite your buddy and his kid over to watch the game at your house. Drink some cheap beer, get some wings from the grocery story deli/Pizza Hut (Or make snacks yourself (!)), play some pool at halftime.
Can you get season tickets only to home games (or is that how they work, I don't even know)? 
Seriously why do you guys keep trying to do that? The one hobby a year I go do without my wife (even though I really wish my wife was into it and came with me, but oh well she's not).
Still need the season ticket though to get the seat I want (next to my friend). If i just go hunting for a ticket for the those 4 games on ebay I'll be sitting on the other side of the stadium... not very practical and is a lot more work and possible more expensive.

I thought he was going to buy them in March when he said the downpayment was due but apparently he bought them now... I can't see it fitting in to the February budget unless they're just not doing anything for Valentine's Day (which would probably be a mistake Zaurg).
It's not even about the cost of the tickets at this point (though you still can't afford them). It's about the fact that you know that buying them is going to piss off your wife and make it even harder to curb her spending habits, but you just don't care. You had every intention of working through this financial mess together, as long as she was the only one changing her spending habits.
Well, I'll have a chat with the wife again tonight. I didn't think she wanted me to forgo football this year, at least she didn't say that last night. Last night she said "well just take some $ from my blow" if I needed to. I said I wouldn't need to... I'd still have enough to do a few little things with her (or gifts) and tv and football. And I don't think she's normally going to have any Blow leftover.

I grew up going to football games (missed 3 games total from the age of 3-18) and there where always at least 6 home games.
Alright, I've mainly just been reading this thread for schadenfreude but I'll bite. I'm a terp and we were 1-7 acc last year and 2-10 overall, and I'm wondering who is actually going to buy those tickets from you? I know you moved out of the orange bowl stadium recently and I don't know the capacity of your new place so maybe its smaller or tickets are more in demand or whatever, but it very much seems like you picked the shittiest game you could that fell in a hard budget month(aka when you arent playing non-bcs teams). I know Maryland is basically begging people to buy season tickets, and it seems with the reduced ticket cost plan you are talking about that miami is as well, and I recall hearing problems about y'all selling out. So I'm actually curious, do you really think you'll even be able to sell a ticket for what could easily be the shittiest conference game during the year for face or anywhere close to it? Maybe I'm mistaken and there is a huge secondary ticket market down there, but from the acc games I've seen on tv the last few years with miami vs and unranked team not named fsu the stadium always seems empty as heck.
It ended up with her saying "so you just want to tell grandma to go to hell". I said you did that 100% on your own (working out that selling the car to grandma thing) 100% on your own without my input, then I said so you can go get your car on your own in your name only, I don't want any part of it. Then I was on a roll so I said hey you can handle that 50k student loan debt too on your own. Then she said "and I can move out and take my paycheck with me". 
Got another $1k off the cc's and still no new car. V-day went surprisingly well. Exchanged cards with nice notes to each other, gave her some little chocolates, went out to dinner (total cost of all that = $13.52). Nothing else new.
They do it every year. It's candlelit and they provide tableside service and you can make reservations. You can go next year and get something like the Sweetheart Special (10 hamburgers, two fries and two small drinks for $11.14, plus free cookies) or just order a la carte off the menu.
(total does not include already accrued interest of about $2k)
If we continued to apply 100% of our income after expenses (about $1700/month) towards debt, we'd have $800 to throw at the smallest loan.
Seven years later (totally my fault to stay/get into a stupid youthful relationship101 mistake) my credit is still paying for the mistakes of living with a partner with poor impulse control and a huge misplaced sense of self-entitlement. Every day I am thankful that I didn't have kids with that loving pile of failure and there are far more people out there in my shoes than there are success stories. 
In the end I was advised to treat dealing with this kind of mentality with my ex (and zaurg's wife seems to have) as if you're dealing with an addict, and this made the breakup a lot easier to justify and cope with when it was viewed as a sickness instead of something fixable by rational negotiations: ) and threats to financially destroy you if you have both your names on assets are par for the course. Even if you get onto common ground for a while a relapse is always waiting around the corner as we're pummeled by hundreds of ads daily for things we're told we deserve/have earned by existing/need.
She keeps saying she needs the car because of her back. But I called her out on that... the main reason she has sore back/neck is from poor posture while breastfeeding, the fact she's carrying our ~15lb baby a lot and everything that comes with that that can cause a sore back (bending over while changing child on the bed/couch, bending over while giving baths, etc.). Not JUST lifting her in and out of the car twice a day, as if that's the only cause.
Reducing your payments through IBR extends your loan period and may add interest costs, but any remaining balance — including interest — is forgiven after 25 years of payments (or 10 years for those with Direct loans who work in public service)."
I just saw a car with a Kleen Kanteen (or whatever) bumper sticker on it. 2 things came to mind:
1) ZAURG!
2) Who cares enough about a water bottle to put a bumper sticker on their car?
Her reaction to Dave Ramsey (we watched a few of the DVDs) consisted of her saying "we already know this stuff" and that we weren't learning anything and her falling asleep to it every time after about 15 minutes. I agreed with her that some of the stuff he preaches is common sense stuff but... we were not doing it! We had gone against the common sense stuff for so long, it essentially has to be relearned. I think it had a huge impact on me and I learned a lot.

(Prove us wrong, Zaurg!)
   
   

At church today there was a sign out front saying they're hosting the 13-week Financial Peace University thing. And a good friend is facilitating it. It starts next week. Surprisingly, my wife really wants to do it. I don't think I should pass this opportunity up even if it does involve leaving work early 30mins once a week, as long as my supervisor is cool with it. Yes we already have the DVD's but it would be nice to actually go through the program with the workbook they give out and discuss progress with a group *and* actually do something together with my wife (that was her main reason for wanting to go).
 
Debt can be good if debt is an investment. If you take out debt for a small business (with a legitimate chance of succeeding), its a perfectly acceptable thing to do. If you take out a student loan for a degree (in a non overpriced state school in a good major), its also fine.
Or, if you can afford something with cash, but financing offers a low enough interest rate, (&lt;3%), thats also fine.
What happens if we go get this hypothetical $16k used CR-V, $6k down, $10k loan @ 9% (our bank says they do 5.6% - 13.2% for 2006-&gt; used cars) for 48 months. That's about $250/month. 
The only options are to stick it out with the Civic, switch cars, or do a lateral move (sell Civic, buy a used 4-door car for under $5k) like one of you suggested. Wife thinks the lateral move is more risky because we wouldn't know the car's history and it could breakdown. Went over some of this with her and she said well we can't get a car unless then loan payment is $150 or less... but that's only a $100 difference and that would mean the max amount we could borrow is about $6k @ 9% @ 48 months.
My very first car (purchased in 1995 for 2k cash) was a 1990 Nissan Sentra, but it was manual and had no A/C. Loved that car.
I paid something like 13k (2k down, 11k loan) for a used 98 Altima. And I didn't have a steady job. I was pretty retarded back then too. Some idiot smashed into me on I-95 and totaled it and his insurance company paid off my loan, which was probably for the best now that I think about it.
This is when you have to ask yourself, WWDD (What would Dave do?)
He'd probably want us to pay for his materials. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" title=":)"/>
We don't have a separate joint entertainment. We just have one "Blow" category. We went back and forth on that went (yes, discussed *with* wife) and decided the one category is fine. I agree it's not that big of a deal, the potential benefits of this waayyyyyy outweigh the fact we'll probably pull $100 out of what we would have put towards credit card debt this month. 
It was pretty much exactly like we were expecting. Sit in a circle and just talk about whatever. Some of the couples in the group have been going there for months, 2 couples were there for the first time. I didn't get anything out of it the first time, I just listened, one thing we did realize was that a lot of them regardless of age or how long they've been together have similar problems. Wife said yeah on a few things she could relate a lot. So we'll be going next week and will actually try to speak up, ask questions, and contribute. They are some loud people in there (the women) who enjoy rambling on for a while.

First FPU was tonight. Strangely when we got home, wife actually brought up finance stuff first and had bank web sites open, spreadsheet, and check register, ready to plan things out. We've decided to open a money market account ($500 minimum balance) with our main bank to hold the emergency fund, which is now enough to cover almost 2 months worth of expenses. Plan is to build it to cover a full 6 months ($20,000).
What kind of interest rate are you getting on the MMA? Most MMAs have pretty lovely rates right now - worse than savings account. I think Everbank has a decent one but something like American Express savings account (1.5%) or Smarty Pig (2%) seems to easily rival it.
ING 1.144% (when will it stop dropping every month?)
Mine has come back just a tiny bit, and I'm still breastfeeding (Sade's just over 5 months old now). Here's hoping for a full recovery <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" title=";)"/>
Call it coincidence, but I had virtually none from postpartum (pregnancy, really) with Holly to when I fully weaned her.

Feb we were over our expenses budget a little... I think about $50 over. We were over in Grocery and Blow and under in a few others. Income was around $5600 so we had a ton (~$2400) leftover that went towards finishing off the credit cards. 
Total Expenses 3968 + theoretical "annual fund" (let's say about 350) = 4318
Perhaps, but perhaps you're misunderstanding the point of her "degree". The point was simply to "finish something she started years before". Seriously that was the main point, it wasn't "wow I'm going to get a great job with this". It was her saying you know, I went to FAU ~9 years ago and started this... now I'm going to find a way to finish. In actuality, it wasn't a continuation of the start of a degree (since DeVry didn't carryover any credits), it was the start of a "degree" but a continuation of the fact that she started post-high school education. So yeah, $50k+ just to say "I did it!" in a high-pitched squeal like Reese Witherspoon. This may sound like a bunch of BS but it should be believable, remember we are somewhat retarded.

For what it's worth I vote EF building and car savings for a bit before getting started on the student loans. I'm an avid DR fan, but this is one of two places I disagree with him on - the $1k baby-step 1 emergency fund is too small. Maybe get your EF high enough to take care of one small catastrophe. Enough to cover your maximum yearly out of pocket for health insurance (deductible + coinsurance), or to cover a blown transmission/engine/buy a new beater, or whatever else you can think of (but just whichever one of these is the most expensive and likely to happen).
I agree dropping our EF down to 1k is too little. Starting with enough to cover health insurance deductible sounds good. I thought ours (mine &amp; daughter) was $5000 and I know my wife's is $1500, but I just logged into myhumana.com and found these coverage details:
Out Of Pocket (Stop Loss) Family Health Benefit Plan Coverage $4,000.00 In plan network
Out Of Pocket (Stop Loss) Individual Health Benefit Plan Coverage $2,000.00 In plan network 
Soooooooo...... I've never seen this Stop Loss before. It sounds nice, I need to give them a call. I think $5k will be a good starting point for the EF, which we already have. But the goal for EF eventually will be 6 full months of expenses (student loan min payments included) PLUS health insurance deductibles. It would also be nice to get a job that offered better health ins because this is a pretty large deductible.
If not, Have you thought about overlapping a Roth IRA with your Emergency Fund? You guys are at the age where you really need to begin contributing more. You can always withdraw the principal from your Roth, though withdrawing the interest earned will incur a penalty. Seems like the $6k would cover any immediate needs (giving you time to take money out of the Roth if you need to), so long as you constantly replenish the fund back up to $6k whenever you take money out for an emergency. And then you guys could also get in on the Roth limits each year - making you better off retirement-wise if no emergency does happen. You can also put it in a safe allocation that earns a little bit more interest than that savings account you currently have.
Well I'm lost. I want to be able to buy a good used car with cash, open a Roth IRA for 2009 ($3k required), start repaying student loans, while keeping at least 5k in an emergency fund - all within the next 3 months. I can't figure out how to make this work... must... make... more... money.
- Cancelled Jared card (6 canceled, 8 left)

Currently we pay $132/month (tax included) for 2 cell phones, 1400 minutes, and 400 txt msgs per phone. If we drop the service for 2 phones to 700 minutes and the minimal text message addon (200/month) the monthly price goes down to $99 which includes tax. That puts $33 back into our account to pay towards debt.

- Or try coaching the wife through this (I think it's an important skill to have) to get her to go through the cancellation process over the phone?
- Teach your wife to have a loving spine, as it will serve her well in the future with her new kid (as above), her fiscal responsibility (not saying 'yes' to every single salesman that rams poo poo down her throat)

Every company's cancellation department is Sales. It's called a "retention" department, they will try everything to keep you as a customer (including raising her limit, giving 0%, etc..) so just keep saying no, and for heaven's sake don't agree to any new terms. to test after canceling two more cards that have annual fees. What would be better, continue to pay $118/year in annual fees to keep open these two 19% credit cards, or canceling them and taking a small hit in credit score? By the time the credit score matters again (another mortgage to buy a house? 5+ years from now?) will it really make that much of a difference?

And since we're not using the envelope system we both agreed we'd use the AMEX Miles card for the majority of expenses from now on, then pay it off each month. That way we can get the miles (to get tickets or gift cards with) and not have to pay any credit card interest.

- Wife wants to sell her Civic to grandma *SATURDAY* (3 days from now) and go with one car for a short while before buying a car, what car that will be I don't know yet. My dad came over last night and raved about the Volvo he's been driving for a few months... a 1989 Volvo he bought for $800. Eight hundred dollars. Since he just got his other junker out of the shop (1985 Mitsubishi pickup) I'd like to offer to buy the Volvo from him. I'm sure my wife will  -&gt; Blow) which really wasn't necessary.

15 bluemountain (has been cancelled)
I understand that and yes sometimes I'm loving dense. I didn't factor all that in (including it being Mother's Day tomorrow) this morning when I declined the zoo trip. I was just nervous as hell about the car thing knowing she wanted badly to do this lease thing and wanted to plan things out. Also I spend a TON of time with my daughter, a ton, my social life is me and my daughter pretty much. I spent some time this afternoon making a mother's day gift for wife from daughter and I. Had to sand it and paint it a few times. So tomorrow hopefully will go great with the gift, hanging out with family, and finally buying a car.

So are the latest responses reading the thread where I said we're going to buy an old used CR-V with cash? After factoring in our "trade-in" (selling to grandma) cash, we're paying $5000 (9k - 4k). I think this is a pretty good option financially, only second to the option of roughing it out for another year or two with the 2-door Civic.

(zaurg sets the bar low with the best of them)

We've been "sleeping on it" or fighting about it for almost 2 years. Wife wanted a new(er) 4-door car/suv way before our daughter was born. But yes this used car purchase is to the extreme of impulsiveness, I totally see your point. And yes my wife is making me buy this car after I've talked with her and convinced her to hold off buying it... for 2 years. Hey look... even in the OP about 10 months ago I mentioned getting a new car.
(cordblood)
If you have genetic issues in your family, a lot of times people will use it for that (cord blood from second child, could help first, etc). But really I'll reiterate what was said above, it's mostly a super high pressure guilt trip.
All of this sort of seems like a waste to me. At least the other stuff seems more like quality time. Also, you guys ate out twice, presumably ate at the Easter party for $90, had pizza at poker night, had pizza again, had McDonalds and Subway, and your wife eats out for lunch at least some of the time which is covered under a different budget. With a full week's worth of "Blow" dining out and some lunches covered, how are you spending $600/month on groceries? That's like $200/week between two people, and it apparently doesn't even include alcohol. What's causing the change and does the budget have to change to reflect it (e.g. your daughter moving to baby food from breast milk) or is it just sloppiness? 
   
   

What the hell is a dealer fee all about? I've bought a bunch of cars from dealerships and don't remember ever explicitly paying a "dealer fee." Taxes are done at registration time (in CO, anyway), so all I've ever given the dealer is the $xxxx price of the vehicle.
It actually was an insightful post (seriously this time). I never ignore his posts but 99% of the time they are just statements regarding how horrible I am.
 the dealer fixes the door, you should also look at major maintenance intervals to see what is close or overdue (i.e. timing belt) and use whatever you find as a bargaining chip. 
$8295 + $120(tag/title fees) + $526(sales tax) = $8941 OTD.

I think you've said retirement will have to come later, but keep in mind that you can only save so much in retirement accounts each year, combine that with the fact that you're missing out on compound interest, and it can be tough to catch up. I think you should stick to a budget with your goals too - you'll set aside $X for retirement, $X for paying extra on your student loans, and then a smaller $X can go to your short term goals (which tend to be wants). Yeah, it may take you longer to get to your short term goals (wants) but I think you have to learn how to deal with having multiple goals vs. just attacking each one, one at a time, because I think you're going to have a tough time when you finally reach "Retirement Goal" time.
In other zaurg-financial-related news, we're going to do a HUGE garage sale in two weeks. I'm going to sell so much poo poo from this hoarded-up condo it's going to look like we just moved in. Selling each thing individually on CL or Ebay would take years... I think the garage sale is a good idea. For the big ticket items (barely used baby swing, etc.) I'm going to have a printout of the retail price and description, I think that should help convince the buyers it's worth more than 5 bucks.

I just like looking at people's cars, I won't bash you or anything. I just want to see it. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" title=":)"/>
(maybe post a picture of the locking mechanism too, if there's anything visually broken)
but I've got absolutely no desire to replace my 1994 Nissan Pulsar (Yeah, I know, shut up; I only really need a car for city driving) until it either disintegrates under me or becomes too expensive to maintain. Is having an up-to-date trendy loving car really worth taking on a constant load of debt?
I'm pretty much with you on this one. I'm 32 and I've purchased 2 cars in my life for my own driving purposes. First was a 1990 Nissan Sentra for $2k cash and I sold it when I moved out of the country. Second was a used 1998 Nissan Altima. Since the Altima was totaled in 2001 I've driven my dad's 1985 Mitsubishi pickup (free) and then inherited a 1993 Saturn when my grandmother died, which I've driven since 2003.
(USER WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THIS POST)
The sad thing is I did negotiate price. Left the dealer the first day (Sat). Got a callback from them the next day (mother's day), they came down a little, I said that wasn't good enough. They called the next day after that and came down more and I said ok as long as the they fix the lock. Went in Tues and the price wasn't as low as he said over the phone and he said "well that was before you wanted us to fix the lock". I said no I'm not signing that until the price is lowered to what we said over phone and the lock is fixed... and they lowered it and fixed the lock.
When does the "seasonality" for this job start back up again? Did you do a good enough job that you can get rehired when it starts up again (and find something stupid to do in the meantime, while searching for a permanent real job?) 
Season is about from Nov-Apr. Last year they hired 12 seasonal employees and let them go one by one until 2 of us were left to work until the last day. The 2 of us were the best (Hey I'm a great tech support monkey!! I'm the best of a bunch of crappy idiots who take 0 pride in their job, yay!!) so yeah the likelyhood of working there again is very good. I was hoping they'd hire us on full-time but they couldn't afford it.
The place we're still doing group couples counseling (group is free) also does 1-on-1 private counseling which is $25 per session iirc.
 ) she got a notice that their "unemployment rate" was jumping up a ton. So I don't know for sure if that was coincidence or of that's actually how it works in Florida.
Just got finished with a phone interview. The manager was apparently in a conference call so he had his web graphic designer call me with a bunch of technical questions and I NAILED them. drat this job sounds like it would be so perfect. And it's a freakin bike ride (2 miles) from home.
So you're making money/budget-conscious decisions (due to your unemployment) which prevent you from going to therapy, but you'll gladly be lax with your wife's overspending and you'll buy a new car? Straighten your priorities.
Zeta's post and probably the fact that I made some progress on the job front today motivated me to go for a run tonight. First time since November 2009. It feels good. Jogged ~13min, walked 1min, jogged 4min, for a total time of 18:37 (2 miles). Last April I ran it (2 miles) in 15:54.
You really ought to have a list, on paper, of the poo poo you need to do. It helps you organize your life and will keep you motivated to stay on top of them. Also, crossing things off a list has an amazing feeling for many people (me included).
   
   

That's a decent plan, thanks. The problem is my list is constantly changing. Tomorrow I'm taking the cat to the vet, going to the bank, doing more prep work (going through stuff around the house) for garage sale this Saturday, vacuuming and doing a carpet cleaning. And I'm only getting that much done because grandma is watching my daughter for the day.

You guys saying "omg I wouldn't be surprised if she's knocked up 2 weeks from now!" didn't read the part that we've been doing this for 7 years. I feel sorry for those of you (married) using condoms. They suck pretty bad. 
Saying you bought a $5000 car implies that, even if your timing was poor (it was) and your reasoning was poor (it was) that at least you got a good deal.
What year was that Volvo? My dad bought a early 90's Volvo for $800, but I don't know how many miles it has. I would have easily done something like that (bought a "beater").
New quote he gave me: $470. I questioned the increase in price just for the tensioner ($158 -&gt; $470) compared with what they charged me in 2005 to replace these same parts and he lowered it to $420.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh god gently caress I hate this. What do I pay for it to get towed to another mechanic and let someone else gently caress me up the rear end? Or pay ($150? more?) and spend a week trying to do it myself?

I thought I already answered this. The previous job was for 4 months (Dec to April) There were no internal positions, but I still tried for that. Yes I've been applying for jobs. No I didn't start early enough... I started in February and I knew the contract would be ending in middle of April.

Another option might be to check out a junkyard for a car like yours. I got a spare tensioner for the Volvo for $10 (warrantied, even) and got to see how it went together before I started loving around with my own car.
Well it's too late, I gave them the go ahead to replace the belt and tensioner. I remember now they always say they only use "original Saturn parts", which is why they charge a lot more for the parts. For example the tensioner directly from Saturn is $140 or so (mechanic said $159), but yeah if you go online or auto parts stores you can find them for $50-75 or maybe cheaper.
I do have AAA. The tow when the belt busted to the mechanic (5 miles) was free. The belt didn't completely break it just frayed a lot and I stopped 10 seconds later.

They have no concept of altering their lifestyle to adjust for their new income level - She's probably just going to the same exact salon she's always gone to. Just looking at numbers for the salon down the road from me (I'm in the midwest) - it's $65+ for a wash/cut/dry and $55+ for color so that's about $120 - plus tip - would usually equal around $144. And it's not like this is the fanciest salon in town. The $130 may seem crazy to guys but it's not so crazy for a women's salon.
Judging by the tensioner, you literally only need a ratchet, a socket the correct size (17mm maybe?) (or a box wrench might work better) and the belt's off. Two more bolts and the tensioner's off. That's. it. 
I actually enjoy changing serp belts. I think routing it over and under the various pulleys is kind of fun. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" title=":)"/>
(I assumed $60/hour labor rates, not sure what they are in your area)
$50 belt (estimating)
+ 2 hours labor ($75/hr) $150
1) let the Saturn rot and stick with 1 car
2) buy a new car (junker, good used car, whatever)
3) spend the bunch of time and study my Haynes manual and the how-to's on the web and hope I'm able to fix it myself, as well as spending at least half of the $400 (Cornholio's estimate of $30 or $60 or whatever he said to replace belt, tensioner, and do an oil change, and buy all the tools for those jobs - is a bit off).
4) pay $400 and get it fixed today

I acknowledge that it would be harder for Zwife since she is faced with a judgmental harpy family &amp; friend base (or so it seems) where as my friends are either carless (the most wealthy couple I know...) or own POS themselves.
On that note... Speaking from experience here: yes, all those airbags and seatbelts work. I walked away, my head hit the curtain airbag rather than the pillar while rolling over. Roomate also walked away (was riding shotgun). Before anybody asks, no, it wasn't DUI (highway flash flooded, hydroplaned).
Well said and I agree. I've taken those steps for other things like installing my head unit and then troubleshooting when it didn't work (blown fuse). It's fun figuring that stuff out yourself. With the latest thing for some reason I felt I had to get it fixed quick and getting under the car and playing around with that stuff that is 100% foreign to me sounded like it would take a long time. I'm slow with those things and often those how-to's are written for people who already have auto mechanic experience or at least understand how a car works (I don't).
   
   
 
Wife says she doesn't even have a mortgage, her home is paid off, and she has plenty of money to pay the remaining $500. So she's just being an rear end in a top hat. (According to the wife)

As you can see I budgeted $203 over expected income, and didn't even make that, so the effort wasn't much this month. Credit card balances are 0 so we must have ate into the buffer we had in checking or dipped into savings a bit. Student loans are due in July. I submitted 2-week claim for unemployment today (that's how it works, June 1st was the first day I could submit it after I applied on May 16th), hope it goes through, if it's denied I'm appealing. at all times it makes it hard to focus on realistic poo poo... yesterday she's calling me saying there's a possible great deal on a rent-to-own home and that I should call a realtor to see if our condo could be sold (despite me showing her tons of info about how we owe $95k on the mortgage and recent sales(non-sales) and market value is LESS than that).

She is panicking. She has major issues with where we live and I don't understand a single one of them. Every time I try talking to her about this stuff we get nowhere and it usually ends up with her crying and her saying that I'm saying everything is her fault, and that's without me yelling or anything, I just ask questions and she cries and then I say goddamnit this is why I shouldn't even talk (because I say the wrong things and she gets upset). It's ridiculous. She's also been pushing for me to sell the 1993 Saturn for $800-1000 so we'll have more money to pay loans with and was literally freaking out about how I put $400 into it when she thought we agreed we wouldn't put any more money into that old car. Another issue she told me recently is her issue with the fact that I purchased this condo before we got married, so my name is only on it, and we canceled a lot of her credit cards and "everything is in your name, nothing is in my name, I'm basically non-existent, If I died you wouldn't even have to change anything". She brought this up after she saw the CR-V title had my name first, then her name "zaurg OR zwife" and she was pissed about that. I was like "what? why does that even matter"? Ok I'm rambling now.
(yes I know the Civic sale isn't "income" but that's how it's going in the goddamn spreadsheet)
$583 is the minimum monthly payment. She paid $2000 towards one loan to *almost* get rid of one loan and one of the payments. But yeah she realizes $583 is a lot and without us getting more income (or cutting expenses by a lot?) we can't afford it.

Wife still has 4 cards (Visa, Amex, CapOneVisa, CapOneMC). We'll see if I can convince her to cut those up.

She had a total of 6 cards in her name. Now she has 3 (a 4th is in both our names), so I was able to get her to close 3 of them.
For simplicity, I'm adding the current total student loan balance (50,919.40) to all past CC balances for a historical Total Debt Snowball.
I just want to thank zaurg (and CornHolio) for being an inspiration. I'm one paycheck away from having zero credit card debt, having been about $20k deep when I first started reading the CornHolio thread.
Yeah paying extra on mortgage I think is literally years away (after student loans are gone). I just didn't know what the deficiency judgment and forced sale stuff is.
It means if your condo is foreclosed and sells for less than the loan amount (which it probably would), the bank can sue you to recover the difference. In non-recourse states the bank would have to eat the difference
Oh wait, is that just like that to prevent people with a bunch of money from stopping payments on their mortgage if they're underwater? I was wondering a while ago what people were doing if they owed $150k on their $80k condo like my wife's cousin (I should find out what she's doing).

I'll checkout the kitchen lights later today. Before that I have a munchkin to feed and go for a walk and put down for a nap. Then going to client to take one of their point of sale computers which needs a new hard drive and complete reinstall. I've been there a couple days this week (When 1 thing crashes, 3 others have to crash the same week, always) so that's some extra money I got coming in. While working on those issues I informed them they hadn't been backing up their POS database, the last backup they had was September 2005. Yikes. So I'm setting up automatic backups for that too.
$15hr * 40 hrs/wk = $600/wk * 4 = $2400. Ok so if we put her in a school for the month and the school cost $1000, we'd still be on top $1400 minus taxes. Or maybe have wife watch her 1 day, grandma 1 day, in school 3 days, and see if they'll come down in cost. Looks like I'll be calling schools tomorrow morning. (Yes this should have been done already!)

Do you have any unemployed friends or family who you trust or a friend or family member who does seasonal work (like a teacher?) or is a student who may want to watch them or be able to watch them? 
How much would the normal tech guy charge for this work (not including the hardware cost)? that I've used in the past (personal use) but it seems too easy and doesn't work all the time. to scan and recover files. Hasn't failed me yet (unless you count the 3 drive RAID clusterfuck my dad sent me, even tried RAID Reconstructor and couldn't get anything)
ok, I charged $80 (2hrs, $40/hr) for this, which involved me taking the computer home so I could work on it during their business off hours. I think I'm pretty fair with the price. Anyone in South FL need stuff like this PM zaurg.
"Diagnosed corrupt hard drive. Researched and purchased new hardware. Installed and tested hardware. Installed all required software and all updates applied. Restored all connections and all software (PC Charge, POS, Quickbooks) configurations and data. Setup automatic daily backups."

Hell no, took a lot longer. Counting the drive to CompUSA and back, it has to be 6+ hours. In fact I forgot to include some extra time for the half day I spent at their store running chkdsk just to get the system (while it was still on the old hard drive) back up! After that it still had bad sectors and was running slowly so that's when I advised they get a new drive. I'm gonna update it now and give them the invoice tomorrow. And no, I didn't count the time it took Acronis to image the drive, which I just left running overnight.). Either doing something like you said or I'm sure they would appreciate something practical like a t-shirt of their favorite team or a honey baked ham.
Don't trust your feelings. We do it all the time we just don't know how to compromise. To make progress both sides have to budge (been talking about this in counseling a lot lately) and we seem to rarely do that.
   
   
 that I've used in the past (personal use) but it seems too easy and doesn't work all the time.
Thanks for the suggestion. I bought this today at CompUSA for $24.99 because the only other thing I had was an external SATA-&gt;USB enclosure which I have my backup drive in, so anytime I needed to troubleshoot a SATA drive I have to switch drives. And today I have to troubleshoot a PATA drive (got another tech help call today!) so this adapter will come in handy.
But seriously, as a married man, I know how important it is for a man to regularly give his wife reason to continue to believe he is the most awesome guy in her life. Zaurg, you need to work on confidence, spontaneity, listening and communication (which sounds like you are awful at), and maybe you need a few surprises in the bedroom too. You gotta get that dopamine firing in her brain or something so she doesn't compensate with shopping. It just seems so obvious that Zwife is completely off the hook here. I've hated her through this thread, but she took her craziness to such an extreme level (second car, new house), that I'm starting to wonder about her. 
- Still doing the budget (but yesterday for a moment I started to consider dropping the budget/expense tracking for a month or two) 
I had not, thank you. Mortgage goes something like this during the timespan in that chart (30yr, 106k loan, 5.75%, began in Dec 2003)...
*poo poo I forgot to factor in retirement contributions (thanks Ethereal)
*I'm gonna take a big chunk of debt with me to the grave. Maybe I'll croak early and the wife can pay it all off (and buy bulk wonderhangers) with life insurance.
Another thing with regards to your condo: Look up your condo's value on Zillow or another home estimate site. You owe about 95k currently, so you should at least see how far underwater you are (I'm in California so a 95k condo to me sounds like a bargain of the century, but I imagine Florida is much different outside of Miami). I'm willing to bet you're not that far underwater, so you really should not stress too much about the mortgage. You're at 5.75% on 95k of debt, and even if your condo is only worth 75k, you're only going to be on the hook for about 20-25k after costs assuming you do end up being foreclosed on. Like I said previously, just pay your straight mortgage payment for now until your student loans are paid in full, and then you can take a portion of what you paid into those into the principal as an extra payment for the mortgage.
We're starting e-mealz.com in July (coupon code makes it $12.50 every 3 months). Until then we're going to eat the food we have, which is enough for the Duggar family. I swear on my life I'm not going to a grocery store the rest of the month except for diapers &amp; wipes which we're running low on.
I'm not paying PMI. I was paying it when I first got the mortgage because I only put about 9% down, then I got the condo appraised to $160k a year or so later and got the PMI dropped. Obviously the appraised value has dropped but they haven't slapped PMI back on (not sure if they can do that?).
As I was sitting here 20 minutes ago about to write a thank you to yesterday's interview (something I've never done before) I got a call from the HR rep offering me the position. Full-time, permanent, $35k/yr, tech support position. I start tomorrow.
brown 2 lbs of lean ground beef (or 1 lb of beef and 1 lb of sausage meat)
Combine all that in a crock pot and cook on low for at least 8 hours. You have put in &lt;30 minutes of effort to make 10+ servings of delicious, healthy chili for $15 or less (depending on what's on sale). It's literally that simple.
Made this today. Had all the ingredients already (except I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes). It's excellent, thanks.

She wants to put 100% of my paycheck to the student loans (after whatever daycare costs we end up having).
I tried to explain that we needed to start implementing some balance. Instead of paying off the loans in ~2.5 years, let's pay them off a little slower and at the same time build our emergency fund and build enough to open a Roth IRA. She's been putting $75 per paycheck of hers in another savings account with another bank (opened because they gave her $100 to do so) for the past few months, and she thinks that's enough to save for now. She's got $530 in their now. I skimmed Vanguard with her last night and it looks like we need at least $3k to open a Roth IRA. She kept asking what % they payout per month/period and I kept saying it depends on the market and what mutual funds are involved and how they perform... she said she doesn't trust that. Showed her some funds that have averaged &gt; 9% over the last ~40 years but over a short time it'll vary a lot, but it's the stock market and she doesn't trust it.
Also we finished paying off 1 student loan already. It was the smallest loan @ $2516. It takes a little chunk off our total required minimum payments per month ($583 -&gt; $555) which is good.

No clue on the finances. Wife pretty much has stopped entering expenses into the spreadsheet and when I ask her every couple days what she spent, or ask her nicely to just put 'em in the spreadsheet, she says she'll do it and won't tell me what she spent, and she doesn't enter them. Today she had to stop at the grocery store to get cranberry juice, I say ok I'll wait out in car with the kid, she takes 10 mins so I'm like oh hey what did ya get (because I could clearly see 2 bags full) and she says "just cranberry juice" so I poke my head around and see other stuff obviously and she goes off on a rant about how "this is why I don't tell you about stuff"... I saw baby food, a sub, and other stuff in there, so I said "why on earth would I have an issue with you buying baby food and your lunch??????????". Seriously she was trying to hide from me buying some baby food and her goddamn lunch! What the gently caress have I turned her into here? This poo poo is insane, I really don't understand what's going on in her head.
I had a crazy idea today, and perhaps it's been suggested in this thread, that we should each have our own checking accounts and 1 joint checking. Since we're now both getting 2 paychecks a month, we direct deposit into our own accounts, then go down the list of monthly expenses like mortgage, electricity, childcare etc, and divvy them up 50/50 or whatever, then we both throw that amount into the joint checking each month to pay the bills. Whatever we have leftover in our own accounts we can do what we please with and we can negotiate things like we have to each put $100/month into joint emergency fund, I'll give you $200/month towards student loans, etc etc, whatever we negotiate. Point is whatever is leftover is ours to do with whatever (put in savings, retirement, blow).
Did the budget this month already *WITH* the wife *WITHOUT* any fights (yet)!
I posted this earlier in the thread, here's an update on what I called our "Variable Expenses". This is what we spent on "Variable Expenses" which includes groceries, restaurants, lunches, entertainment, gifts, charity, clothes, vacations, and misc blow expenses. It does not include mortgage, utilities, insurance, medical payments, auto gas, auto repair, or any expenses related to our child (such as medical payments, clothes, furniture, toys).
How long do you think your wife using the envelope system will last? Because my money's on until she needs 100 dollars of groceries (which goes on the card) and throws in 30 dollars of blow on top of that (supplies for a party!), also on a card. Or when she realizes she needs that last 20 in cash to buy her lunches, but the kid really deserves 50 dollars in toys...
Definitely backslid. The idea with the envelope is it gives her freedom to manage that $150 per month as she wants without me asking for receipts. We're only 6 days in but I asked her today if she's liking it and she said yes it's much nicer not having me ask every night what she spent for the day, where's the receipt, etc. It also has us watching that $150 a lot closer it seems since we know it has to last the month, whereas before it was just a number on a spreadsheet we (I) checked every couple days. Today she told me she got soup at lunch but drove a mile to pick it up instead of having it delivered like she usually does, to save a buck or two. I forgot my lunch in the fridge so I drove home for lunch. We'll see how long it lasts, you know I'll keep you updated.

I forgot to comment on the paying off loans plan. She suggested going full force on the loans for the rest of this year then start a more balanced attack in 2011, which I agreed to. I don't know if "gave in" is the best way to describe it - I mean it is technically *our* debt, which we should be paying off as quickly as possibly. She could say "hey, you bought the condo, you pay the mortgage ($710/month, 96k total) and I'll pay my student loans ($555/month, 47k total)" which I wouldn't be thrilled with, ya know?
So far she's doing better with the envelope than I am, but that's because I still have two payments left ($58 each) for the Canes football tickets.

Breetai, a graph for student loans, mortgage, and total debt will be coming soon. When I start contributing to emergency fund again I'll do one of those... right now it would just look like July 2009 ($14,200) to July 2010 ($5014) which is just cash savings not including the retirement account.

   
   

Yeah the plan is to pay over a $1000 every month ($1839 this month) for the rest of the year, then throttle it back a bit to build up the emergency fund. That was the compromise.
I don't really have the data available to whip that up. But it would surely be a strong nosedive over the past 3 years given the extreme drop in property value combined with the obtaining of 50k in student loans. My current estimate shows Net Worth = $(22,188). In 2006 before the property drop and before the student loans, drat it looked a lot better even with all that credit card debt! Net worth then was around +$88k if I'm calculating correctly. Got married in early 2007 and the credit cards went way up in 2006 due to a lot of wedding expenses. drat is there a correlation here?
 
That's it exactly. Consolidating would make managing the payments a little easier but that's about it (we'll probably move to automatic payments shortly to shave off 0.25% off the interest). If one of us lost our job and we needed to reduce minimum payments we'd consolidate because we could get the min down to the $300/month range that way. 
Nam Taf, did you notice how your graphs nosedive around the middle of April and shoot back up at the end of June? Guess what I was unemployed during that time. And I'm *still* waiting the agency's determination if I can get unemployment from back then. (Does it usually take this long?)
We've improved immensely regarding giving less gifts. Last year from July to December (Christmas included) we spent $540 on gifts and charity. In 2008? $4300 for the year.
SomeGuyinIL said it best: You are treading water, but you have it in your head that that's ok. What happens if your kid needs surgery? What happens if you lose work again? You're hosed, because your control over your spending is quite obviously being lost (see again my graphs). Any unforseen major expenditure will bury you in debt again. Your 14k savings is now only 6k, so you can't use that to avoid debt if it's a significant cost.
Right now our income is higher than it's been since June 2008 (even without considering the on-call extra income), not sure where you get the 6-12 months timeframe from.
What happens if (not if, when) a big expense happens? In the past we used a credit card for that. Now we want the emergency fund to handle it. Right now we have 5k in the emergency fund. If we're hit with an expense(s) higher than that obviously we'd have to use a credit card. Building the emergency fund is a process and the decision was to work on paying off the loans for the next few months then start contributing to the emergency fund again. I've heard a suggestion from KarmaCandy to "balance" things instead of throwing $1500+ month towards the loans, what would you suggest as far as that? Pay minimum on student loans ($555) and build emergency fund as quick as possible? Consolidate student loans to get minimum down to ~$350/month, then build emergency fund as quick as possible? Balance it 50-50? Maybe we're doing it backwards, I don't know. I think Dave Ramsey would say pay them off 100% then go back to the emergency fund. Ultimately I want the emergency fund to have at least 6 months worth of month expenses, which would be about $20k so we're way below right now. 
We're putting $24.61 per month into a Florida Prepaid college fund for my niece. It was a gift. It's a tough decision for me to just say "oh yeah we said we'd do this but now we're pulling the plug and taking back the money" - that's just wrong. One option we were looking at is stopping the contributions but setting up a savings account with the money already contributed (about $1000 iirc) for my niece. Or we can keep contributing $24.61/month and when it's fully funded if she wants to go to college, bam, we can help. If you're asking why we did it in the first place years ago when she was a year old, there are a handful of reasons.

You are correct about giving a gift for birthday and Christmas, because the college thing is the "old gift" (which always brings on arguments with wife and I, I always point out that we're already giving her a gift, she says "oh but this is just $15" and gives her another gift)
So that $50-100/paycheck wife was putting in her own savings account (TD Bank is the worst bank in the world, btw) added up to $680, which she withdrew and closed out the account today. Our auto insurance renewal is next month for $660, so bam there it is. Saving worked. We need to start doing that for other things.
Wooohooo, I finally got some unemployment compensation. $1200. Too bad my dumbass waited a month before filing a claim (Job ended in mid-April, I filed claim in mid-May) or I would've received twice that. Thanks to this thread for convincing me to do it. I filed on May 16th and got the money deposited on July 21st... took a while and quite a few phone calls to find out wtf was going on, and I still don't know wtf the process was.
Of course part of me hates the idea of actually closing the account because it's $5000 for 2 years of college (which is good for college prices in 2022 when she'll be graduating high school). We opened that account in 2004 so those were the rates then. When we opened the same account for our daughter it had already jumped to ~$8000, imagine what it'll be in 2022?

Nah, we're not taking a gift back. We are taking the specific Florida Prepaid gift back (which you agree is the right move, like everyone else in this thread, right?), but she'll get help from us for college in another way down the road. There is no drama.

There's a decent chance my mom will come into a decent chunk of money within the next couple years and she said one of the things she'd do with it is setup college funds for her grandchildren (my niece would be one of those). Not counting on that, but it would be nice.

Zwife made the total 180 after more discussion we had this past week about buying a house, which she wants LAST WEEK. I too want a bigger home but only after a) getting student loan debt to 0, b) having at least a 10% down payment, c) having a decent chunk of savings for repairs/upgrades to the new house, d) at least a 3 month emergency fund, and e) money going into retirement fund every month. That is years away and she knows it. She hates where we currently live and the "I want it now" attitude is in full effect. She keeps talking about "well if we can sell the condo for at least $120k we'll have enough for a down payment", meanwhile a foreclosed unit downstairs is currently listed for $51k. FIFTY-ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. Pretty depressing. I'm not crazy about where we live... 2nd story condo... pain in the rear end with no yard to play in, etc. But I'm perfectly content living there and raising our child there with a very manageable mortgage until we can afford to buy a house. I touched on this subject a while back, you can expect it to be a major issue for us for the foreseeable future. 
In fact you know what, I'm going to talk to her again tonight and lay it all out exactly how I feel about this. I'll be honest in the past I've just said "yeah ok cool, yeah that might work" and led her on for weeks/months at a time (see: new car) just to avoid fighting with her until we finally get close enough to make a move and then I back out. I'm not going to do it this time but I fear what will happen.

I like how zaurg's toxx punishment for his W&amp;W; log is very fiscally irresponsible because if he fails he will have to sell his football season tickets (for a loss), and then when he later completes his goal he will be able to go to the games again (by buying tickets for a higher rate than if he had season tickets)
5 years rolled around (November 2008) and I'd just lost my job and housing market was crashing (or crashed already? I forget)
(these are the prices I was given by Wife, so it would be safely conservative to add an extra 20%, making it $480 total)
• Familiar with automation software applications such as Helm, Plesk, WebsitePanel (formerly .Net Panel). 
Zaurg. You're killing me. Isn't your kid turning 2? Mine just turned two and I didn't even get her a present (as we were buying a house). We just made her a cake. She loved it anyway!
The first game is the easier game of the year. It's a game I usually go to just to watch the FAMU band at halftime. It's a game I can skip (sell the ticket). After that the next home game is the game of the year vs FSU on October 9th. So I basically have till October 9th to get to 170 lbs. I just realized how much time I have and gently caress YES I can do it! (Actually it's turned my TOXX into a pretty lame goal, lol)
(I grew up in Florida and we were not rich so if you ever need low-cost ideas for birthday trips or whatever, ASK)
I'm hoping to make her 100k degree (my neck just twinged typing that) closer to 60k.

Well, the funny thing with jobs is that you normally have to go out and look for them. No one is going to come looking for you (unless you have special skills and get headhunted.)
I like how you get more riled up about an avatar than your wife spending hundreds of dollars on a stupid weekend away behind your back (allegedly).
College 63 / 63 (cancelled)
Total In (7196) - Total Out (3765+1839+63) = +1529
- Blow category created for extra poo poo that didn't come out of our spending cash but probably should have come out of our spending cash but we like to spend too much cash, or something (cue everyone saying I still don't grasp the idea of a budget). That 231 was comprised of;
59.00 for capital one annual fee (wife said she's going to cancel this to get refund, we'll see)
   
   

Won't be able to do that, Nam Taf. Told wife I'm not doing any kind of budgeting in August. Not even going to worry about it for a second. As long as all the bills get paid and we drop the student loan balances by a ton, I'm good, and the wife has been very good with those. Maybe I'll start back up in Sept, maybe not, we'll see. The only thing I am going to keep doing is the $150 spending cash in pocket at beginning of month (minus the 58 for my last payment towards football tickets), that really kept me in check.
 
Why do you want to improve the relationship you have with a controlling, manipulative, spendaholic? You have flashes of hope like every person in an abusive or exploitative relationship, this "epiphany" was not one of them, this epiphany was a regression back into just being another limb or tool for your wife, one she uses to get what she thinks she wants or needs (stability she is too unwell to provide for herself; family/appearance of 'appropriate' life-stages with marriage-&gt;home purchase-&gt;family; CRV for backpain and other tales of manipulation). 
Oh I was a tool for her last night all right (after the epiphany!), for the first time in about ~2 months. HEYOOOOOOOOOO
I can't help but think back about a bajillion pages when everyone was saying "you need to give up those tickets so your wife thinks you're willing to contribute too" and "your wife will resent you for making you give up her love(spending) while you keep yours(tickets)."(USER WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THIS POST)
I'm not going to Sea World this weekend, I'll be on-call at home (on-call is pretty busy it's basically like working all day Sat&amp;Sun;). I'm pretty sure the wife and daughter are going. I think we finally got to a "agree to disagree" point.
