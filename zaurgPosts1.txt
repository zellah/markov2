Correct I haven't followed a budget in... well forever. But certainly not this year. Just looking at the past 3 months. Daughter is changing from private school (9k/year) to public next month. Stab at a budget below to see what I can realistically follow going forward.  
 
 
May: Income $4760, Savings $0, Retirement $290 6%, Expenses $4795 101% 
Jun: Income $4760, Savings (Emergency Fund) $250 5%, Retirement $290 6%, Expenses $5085 107% 
7/24: Income $4954, Savings(Emergency Fund) $250 5%, Retirement $305 6%, Expenses $4355 88%

Utilities $369 8% 
Insurance $458 10% 
Childcare $995 21%

July 
Housing $1,750 35% 
Utilities $516 7% 
Insurance $454 9% 
Childcare $225 5% 
Grocery $494 10% 
Auto $40 1% 
Misc $242 5% 
Blow $533 11% 
Debt $100 2% 
 
 
My first stab at updating budget. Need to see if this is realistic 
 
Category	Monthly 
Income after taxes	$4,900.00 
Extra income	$50.00 (employer covering cell) 
total income = $4,950.00 
 
401k Roth	$305.00 
Emergency Fund Savings	$250.00 
total savings = $555.00 
 
House mortgage	$1,750.00 
House insurance	escrowed 
House property tax	escrowed 
Auto Insurance	$725 bi-annual 
Life Insurance	$24.00 
Health ins me&amp;kids;	$430.00 
Loan repayment	$100.00 
Electric	$150.00 
Water	$75.00 
Internet/TV/Music	$70.00 
Cell Phone	$60.00 
Lawn service	$80.00 
Private school	$0.00 (was $750 per month, gone as of June 2017, oldest daughter switching to free public school next month) 
Childcare/Camps	$400.00 (400 avg per month. ~$2k in summer for oldest daughter. ~6k for youngest daughter daycare/VPK. I cover 60%) 
Auto fuel	$60.00 
Groceries	$500.00 
Misc	$200.00 
Blow	$200.00 
total income = $4,950.00 
total savings = $555.00 
total expenses =	$4099.00 
left over = $296.00
 
 
      

 
 
I don't do drugs. Blow means like  
 
7/1/17	Blow	happy hr 25.20 
7/2/17	Blow	pizza	27.60 
7/9/17	Blow	water park	40.06 
7/20/17	Blow	airbnb	105.00
 
 
    

 
 
I lump these together for Utilities category. I don't have cable TV but I pay $10/month for Netflix which goes into the Blow category. Water bill is paid every 2 months and covers water and garbage pickup. 
 
Utilities	Electric	146.72 
Utilities	Water	147.33 
Utilities	AT&amp;T; Wireless	91.86 (this goes down to about $57-60 next month) 
Utilities	Comcast Internet	49.99 
Utilities	Lawn	80.00 
 
 
So it really works out to about 415 average like this... The $30/month Comcast promotion went away and jumped to 50 so I need to try to get something like that again. 
 
Utilities	Electric	150 per month 
Utilities	Water	75 per month 
Utilities	AT&amp;T; Wireless	60 per month 
Utilities	Comcast Internet	50 per month 
Utilities	Lawn	80 per month

Childcare costs are all over the place because I was paying $750 month for private school which just stopped. Then summer camp is $225 per week but payments are made irregular.

It sounds like you cover 60% of summer camps for your children? What exactly is this 6k/year daycare thing -- is that 10k for summer camp for just her in total then? What does VPK stand for? How much of the health-insurance are you paying, is that 100%? 
 
It's also not super clear -- you have two daughters and zero other children, is that right? How old are they? Is the oldest one old enough to mow the lawn for you?

recent change; 
before: Kid1 $750/month for private school I pay. Kid1 summer camp fees, split. Kid2 $700/month for preschool/daycare, ex pays. 
after: Kid1 free public school. Kid1 summer camp fees plus Kid2 $500/month for pre-k - I need to work this out so I'm paying 60%, ex pays 40%. 
 
4 bedroom house, around 2k sq ft, with pool. Kids stay with me 50% of the time. 
 
VPK is pre-k. Starts next month. VPK is actually free which covers a preschool class from 9am-12pm, so the cost is just to cover from 12pm-5pm "afterschool"/daycare kinda thing.

I pay 100% of health insurance for myself and both kids. Yes two kids age 8 and 4.

Sounds like a great idea just not sure how. 
A guy who works on my team got a second job a few months ago, he leaves job1 and sleeps a couple hours, then works job2 from 11pm-7am, then a little sleep, then back to job1. He looks like a zombie and performance in job1 is suffering. I'm not willing to do something like that.
 
 
   

 
 
401k-Roth, aren't taxes cheaper to pay now?  
 
Auto Insurance, thank you. Renewal is coming up in a month. I just sent them an email with a few specific questions and request to provide lower cost options after reviewing my policy. $1450 per year now and I'm the only driver with a good history, I drive a 15 year old car, and do not have collision coverage. 
Auto Ins is always the same. If I switch providers and save 15-25%, then over the next 2-3 years the cost increases back to what it was even if no changes in policy and no claims. Want to see if I can stick with this one and just lower existing cost.

I really don't know what all that means regarding zoning. Is it uncommon for public schools to require their students live in a certain area? What I meant by the "Zero Homes" search on Zillow was that I searched specifically for the school's zone and Zillow had zero homes for sale that met my search requirements. Plenty of other places to search besides Zillow which I haven't done yet.

250k balance, 30-year fixed @ 4.5%, $1750 monthly payments, which includes a good chunk of that going to escrow to cover Homeowners Insurance (around annual $2600) and Property Tax (around annual $2800).

What all is in misc and blow? 
 </blockquote></div>
 
I totaled up everything I included in the "Misc" and "Blow" categories for the past 3 months. Suggestions/questions please... this has to be a category I can cut down on: 
 
Total 2487 or 829 per month 
 
Common: 
659 Restaurants 
159 Kids clothes/stuff 
126 Medical 
121 House/Pool Supplies 
53 Haircuts 
40 Kids entertainment / Water Park. 
 
Very irregular, explanations required 
314 Running - Stocked up for a long time now. Went a little nuts and bought 3 pair shoes on sale for $60 each, plus other fuel/supplies. 
240 Kids swimming lessons - These are done. They are swimming great which is so awesome. 
229 Gifts - Gave 200 to family (not normal, can't recall the last time I did that) plus Mother's Day gift. 
216 Travel/Vacation - Two trips, both related to running, out of town. 
90 Parking Fine - First parking fine in my life. Won't be doing that again. 
71 Domain Names - I need to get rid of most of this. I think I said that in my old threads and only got rid of a couple and sold one since then. 
25 Fantasy Football - It's that time of year 
 
Regular expenses, same every month: 
67 Gym Membership 
32 Netflix 
30 Google Music 
9 iCloud backup 
6 Checking account fees 
 
 
 
This was a good exercise. Action Items: 
- $220/month on restaurants is too much. Goal: bring that down to $150/month for the next 3 months.  
- Sell/get rid of all domains except the 2-3 I need to keep 
- Don't park where I shouldn't even if the person who lives there says it's fine and had no problems the first 15 times. 
- I can't discount the "Very irregular" expenses because while I may not spend that dollar amount every 3 months, *something* will always come up, I guess the point I need a keep a category to cover "Misc" in budget. 
- Kids clothes/stuff, House/Pool supplies = really spend a bit more time to shop around and find best deals. First example I thought of, pool salt, appears to be $7 at Home Depot instead of the $11 I pay at the local pool store. It's just a bag every 2 months or so, but that's just 1 thing of many. 
- Haircuts. Perhaps I can do this myself. Do guys buzz their own head? Or does it look horrible? Very open to suggestions. Major receding hairline and don't care anymore, just need the thing shortened often.

22 per cut or 22 every 3 months? I think 22 is what I'm paying per cut. At Sports Clips. IIRC $17 for the cut plus a $5 tip. I'm going tomorrow, so 53+22 make that 75 for the past 3 months, 25 per month, changing to 22 per month/cut, or less if I can figure out a better way.

Nah my point was just that zoning likely means that the residential area you're in is legally barred from having smaller (and thus cheaper) homes. This is very common in the states, part of the purpose of zoning is to exclude those poorer than yourself from the neighborhood. 
 
Yeah your misc expenses actually look pretty reasonable, sure you could cut down a bit (especially on 'one-offs' that I'm guessing are not so infrequent), but really it's the housing that's killing you. If you were single and childless I might suggest getting a roommate, maybe even more than one, but I dunno how well that kind of thing would work when you're divorced and sharing custody. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
Ah, gotcha. Thanks.  
 
The housing. Will look closer at what I pay now vs what I could pay if downsizing. Here's now:  
 
Housing Expenses per month 
1750 Mortgage 
150 Electric 
75 Water/Trash 
80 Lawn 
25 Housing/Pool Supplies (170 total spent so far from January to July on "House/Pool Supplies", or about 25 per month. This seems low/lucky. I don't think 25/month is going to be the norm for an average year. I haven't done any repairs or upgrades this year, nothing has broken or need to be replaced yet. So I'm not sure what the true monthly amount over the course of a year in a multi-year span is.) 
 
Am I forgetting anything? Homeowners Insurance &amp; Property tax are built into the monthly mortgage payment

Not giving up guys 
The advice is appreciated 
This is a marathon not a sprint
 
 
    

 
 
You guys are really hammering away on this $80 monthly lawn expense and rightfully so. It's starting to sink in. I'm considering switching back to doing it myself in middle of October. I have all the equipment in my shed. Hopefully still works ok.
 
 
  

 
 
I've thought about it again and decided the $80/month is worth it. Mowing front &amp; back, weed eater/edging, tree trimming, fertilizer application, weed maintenance, and maintaining all the equipment. It's worth it to me. It takes me much longer than an hour. I'll just have to focus on other areas, of which there are plenty, to cut back on discrentionary expenses.
 
 
  

 
 
Giraffe, the big step I can think of right now is to break up with my gf in about 6 weeks. Then stay single and no dating for a few months until I can get it under control by myself. If I can't do that, adding someone else into my life who wants to go out to eat, etc., just makes it harder for me.  
 
During the next 6 weeks I'm just going to think about $ first and decide if I or my kids really "need" something before purchasing.

Taking out the Misc and Blow, you spent $3579 of your $4595 in July on categories with very little discretionary latitude. That leaves you with about $1000 a month for everything else. Every meal out, all clothes and shoes for you and the kids, car repairs, birthday presents, football games, etc. That $1000 will be very easy to burn through even without unexpected surprises, which are definitely going to happen. Cutting down on your grocery bill, utilities and insurance wherever possible will help a lot. Find an extra $200/month in there and stick it in savings every month. Then start carefully monitoring your spending throughout each month to see if you can learn the discipline you'll need to cut out extras before that $1000 runs out. <i>The only purpose of the budget is to get you to rein in your spending when you need to.</i> Ideally, you'll be able to end each month with another $200 or more surplus so you're prepared when the car breaks down or the roof caves in.

What a clusterfuck I am. I started this thread at the wrong time when I knew I had a vacation planned for October that would rack up a bunch of $$. I didn't track crap the past 2.5 months so I spent all morning trying to backtrack looking at a mountain of receipts and looking through credit card statements and checkbook.  
 
I know I'm still missing a couple things... oldest daughter's school aftercare which is $240/month even though she only goes about 3 hours twice a week. Need to look into if they have an hourly option that is cheaper. The August $580 summer camp expense some should go back into July. youngest daughter I'm now paying half the pre-K expenses which is $120 per week so I'll add that. 
 
As you can see I got rid of "Misc" and "Blow" and tried to add it all into a "Discretionary" category along the lines of what Giraffe suggested, so I can just focus on that # going forward.

Zaurg, how are you going to bring your spending under control? 
 </blockquote></div>
 
I'm going to do what Giraffe suggested. 
 
4950 = Monthly Income 
3875 = "Regular" expenses that are mostly paid automatically 
--------------- 
1750 Mortgage 
430 Health Ins 
25 Life Ins 
150 Electric 
150 Water (every 2 months) 
65 Cell 
50 Internet  
80 Lawn 
240 Aftercare 
240 Pre-K 
100 Loan repayment 
250 Savings-Emergency Fund 
305 Savings-Retirement 
20 Gym 
20 Google Play Music and Netflix 
--------------- 
 
That leaves 1075. Let's say an even 1000 extra every month to cover Grocery, Auto, Medical, Clothes, and fun poo poo. This doesn't mean I shouldn't work on lowering the "regular" expenses like Cell, Internet, Lawn, but for right now my focus is controlling that remaining 1000. 
 
How will I control it? I need to keep a daily $ remaining from the 1000. Google spreadsheet, accessible anywhere, no excuse not to check it in a second. 
 
I screwed myself for October already and it's only the 15th. Already OVER the 1000 at about 1034. So I'll just tighten down as much as possible, I have nothing left. Only truly necessities.
 
 
   

 
 
should I share the google doc with this thread?

Disney? Yuck, no. Out of state. Awesome National Parks. That only accounted for about $40 of the vacation expense.
 
 
   

 
 
Water budget isn't important right now. It's automatic. No thought process involved on that. I'm sticking with BFC's advice on this. Focusing on discretionary act of taking my credit card out of wallet and sticking it in the chip reading slot. 
 
It's not going to be easy. Looking at my discretionary $ remaining before any purchase consideration and re-consideration and re-re-consideration is the answer.

Sept was the first month I didn't payoff the full balance, digging myself into a hole. Paid interest charges for the first time this past payment... $7 interest on the AMEX and $40 on the Visa.

As for your spending, stop. Find a cheap mower and mow your own lawn. Stop eating out. poo poo, visit a food bank. Seek assistance and cut out everything optional. Google music and Netflix? You can’t afford those.  
 
Listen to BFC when we tell you that you are poor, and are on the brink of total financial ruin. One bad luck day away from utter personal destruction. Seriously.

Breaking up on Wednesday. 
 
The trip was the best, not sarcastic. 
 
I'm taking this seriously. Starting finally to work on stuff. Couple quick little things... 
 
- I just cancelled google music. 
- I just <s>downgraded netflix from $10 to $8 per month. It's something. I gotta keep just a little bit of TV. $8 per month I'll have to make that work.</s> Changed mind, just cancelled netflix. 
- Tomorrow I have 3 calls lined up...  
ATT to lower cell phone bill, current bill is $66.82 which is comprised of $50 2gb data plan for iphone, $9 insurance, plus taxes.  
Comcast to lower Internet bill. Some promo just ended and it says I'll be paying $64.95 this month for a crappy 25mbit plan.  
Dental insurance and dentist - paid $135 for kids teeth in August and I got the insurance claim summary back and from what I'm reading it says patient responsibility $0 so i'm confused 
 
Dinners already planned for week. I think all I need as far as food for the entire week is just one grocery store stop for some bananas.

CHANGED 
- Netflix cancelled $10/month 
- Google Music cancelled $10/month 
- Comcast internet lowered by about $16/month 
 
NO CHANGE YET 
- AT&amp;T; cell phone waiting for callback from the guy. Hopefully they can lower it a bit from my current $50 2gb data plan. Verizon offers 2gb plan for $35/month and Cricket Wireless offers 4gb plan for $35/month.  
- Dental insurance I guess was correct. But they are regenerating the summary claim with updated info and sending to me. None of it makes sense. They copays in my schedule of benefits don't match with what's on the summary claim or with what I paid the dentist, in fact after reading the copays on the schedule of benefits it seems like I saved money, so I'm going to leave this one alone. Next time will call insurance company as soon as dentist gives me the treatment plan. 
 
 
NEXT UP 
- Considering cancelling my gym membership which is $21 per month. I only use it for a treadmill. It's almost November and the daily temperatures should be coming down a few degrees here in South Florida... making afternoon runs a little more doable. It was under 100 heat index today at lunch. So next May I'll consider signing back up for gym. Thinking about this one tonight.
 
 
    

 
 
1. I'm not good at this. Pick a # for the rest of October... 15 days, all I can think of right now are: 
groceries - $100. This is low for me. I eat a lot. Maybe $150. 
gas - tank is getting low right now so probably a fill up on Wednesday and again right around end of month. Maybe $50. 
younger daughter has halloween costume, older daughter does not. going to try to get ex to handle that this weekend.  
$200-250 range sounds doable for rest of month. Does that sound crazy unlikely low? High?  
 
2. Agreed 
 
Will have to set a budget for Christmas. Bikes on craigslist, $20, nice.

Many here suggested I look into refinancing. It struck me as odd at first because I just refinanced less than 2 years ago for a 30-year fixed, but the rate is 4.5%, so I guess if I could get that lower without paying a ton of fees, it's worth it?  
 
How much more would it cost me in the long run... I don't know, good question. All I've been thinking about is my monthly stuff.
 
 
    

 
 
hell yes 
 
I just changed my AT&amp;T; cell phone plan. It took until the 3rd person I chat/spoke with to find out they have lower cost prepaid plans. Today I just straight up said I need to cancel because I can't afford it and i'm switching to a low-cost provider like Metro. They got me switched to a prepaid plan quick. 
 
Old plan: $66.82 for 2gb data plan 
New plan: $32.50 for 1gb data plan 
 
I think someone years ago in previous thread suggested switching to a cheaper prepaid plan. Finally got it done

Congrats on making progress! 
But you need to work on your food, How many people are you feeding per meal on average? What are you buying? You need to stop eating out, that saves you quite a bit of money right there, and maybe start meal prepping. 
Next time you go grocery shopping snap the receipt and post it. Might be able to help you save some money there.

Needed more than bananas. It's just me plus 2 kids 15 days per month. 
 
I did skip a few things I had written down on the list. Trying to focus on true "needs". Should have skipped cream cheese, already have butter and peanut butter. Went store brand for everything that was cheaper. I'm sure i could save a few bucks going to a mixture of Walmart/Target/Trader Joes but this was all at Publix.

</blockquote></div>
 
Paid off the AMEX $800 balance today so I have two balances now: 
 
Visa credit card, $4375, 16% 
 
Personal loan $6000, 5% 
 
I'm going to continue the automatic monthly $100 minimum payments on the loan and throw as much as I can at the Visa. 
 
I've built my emergency fund up to $1250 over the past 5 months putting $250 per month in at the beginning of the month. I was considering throwing all that at the Visa but I'm just going to keep it. That's the right move right? I mean yeah I'm paying interest charges on the Visa, but the emergency fund is literally all I have in savings. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-saddowns.gif" title=":saddowns:"/>

I'm assuming that's grub for a week or so? What do you do for protein?  
Honestly If you can spend $100 or so a week on grub and cut eating out you would be in good shape.  
Nothing on that receipt sticks out as unneeded or out of line to be honest. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
This is a change for me. Usually that receipt has salsa, chips, beer/wine, 5 other random things I find in the store, other random fruit, some extra veggies, etc etc etc.  
 
Will be buying a large pack of chicken breast which I think is about $2-$2.50 per pound. Usually buy the single pack of 2-3 breasts at $5 per pound.
 
 
  

 
 
Got this budget thing to $1223 left over. I can switch child2 to part-time aftercare ($120/month) which is 2-4PM, instead of the full-time aftercare 2-6PM ($240/month). Only need it one day a week at most and that day my employer will allow me to pickup @ 4 and bring her to work with me.  
 
What am I missing? I think everything is here. The problem is what I do with the "left over". Lawncare is still there. Might get rid of it along with the gym - cooler weather for both - soon - maybe.

Goal for November is still to keep discretionary under $1000 
 
Whatever is left from the 1223 will go towards Visa balance so I can get that to zero quick. 
 
Once Visa is to zero then I'll increase monthly savings and increase my payment to personal loan to help speed that up, even if just an extra 50.

Thanks. Early morning running is possible about 15 days per month and I do take advantage of that. I just checked my log and in September I ran treadmill 4 times and in August 8 times.

So I feel like having $1000.00 discretionary might be a really bad idea. Break down what you are spending that money on, find areas where you can save and set some goals.  
I mean you need to get your loan balances moving south and you need more of an emergency fund than 1200 bucks.  
Maybe you don't deserve 1000 bucks to have fun with?

I’ll second this. Take iCloud for example, you are just now including that in your budget. Maybe it’s new? Maybe it was always there in misc. Maybe it’s Mabeline. 
If you break up that G into what you are going to use it for, you can start looking at what (if anything) derails you. 
</blockquote></div>
 
 
I agree I don't deserve 1000 bucks to have fun with. Not even 1 buck. 
 
Please keep in mind the 1000 "discretionary" includes grocery, medical, auto gas expenses. iCloud is for iPhone backup, $3 automatic payment. I consider it part of my cell phone expense.  
 
 
I want to stick with what Giraffe suggested! I used to break up the $1k into many different categories. Throwing it all into one "Spending" aka "Discretionary" category simplifies it so I'm just looking at one number. I agree with the goon who said I don't have a finance/budget problem, I have a BEHAVIOR problem I need to fix. The act of taking cash/card out of wallet and spending for the problem areas: Restaurants, Entertainment, Random purchases/wants, etc. And also to put more thought into Grocery store trips and stick to needs.

Why is your health insurance listed in your budget? Isn't that tax deductible no matter how you slice it? How much do you owe / get back each year for taxes? 
</blockquote></div>
 
It's an expense so I thought it should be listed. Yes it's taken out of my paycheck before taxes. There is no spending/thought process involved... it's just a number on the budget. Also when health insurance rates go up/down I don't want it to appear like my income has decreased/increased. This past year 2016 I got a $6k tax refund. The year before 2015 I paid a poo poo load. Year before that 2014 I got about a $1500 refund. All over the place. This year it'll be a refund but hopefully under 2k... I'd prefer to keep that money coming to me each month instead giving a loan to the government for the year.

I just paid another $1000 towards the Visa balance, directly from my checking. I haven't touched the $1250 in my emergency fund account. Not sure if I should.  
 
So Visa credit card now looks like this: Current Balance $3376, Available Revolving Credit $6218 
 
Checking balance: $1650 
Emergency Fund balance: $1250 
 
...so I could throw more at Visa... I feel more comfortable keeping about a 1k minimum in checking though.

Habits are a motherfucker. 
 
Have you set any specific goals? Like pay off the Visa in X many months or save X amount of money by Y? It might help to do some soul searching and really try to figure out what you are trying to accomplish and then we can help you figure out a way to work towards that.  
From my point of view, you don't have any financials problems that really couldn't be fixed in a reasonable amount of time. Unless I'm missing something obvious, which is possible, you could be more or less debt free in 2 years if you just tighten your belt a little and stick to a plan.

TWO YEARS?  
 
Damnit why did I run up this Visa card. The vacation was great but I could have throttled everything months ago and saved up and done it properly next year and just stuck with local marathon until then. 
 
I need to zero out that Visa card ASAP. 
 
The personal loan was originally $7500 at 5% for 7.5 years to make a $100 monthly payment, started in early 2016. If paid entirely throughout in $100 monthly payments that means about $1500 interest so $9k total.

I think the bolded part is the most relevant. Zuarg has been treading water for 8 years now, with some vague idea about getting control of his finances, but no actual concrete goals, which is probably why he usually fails. He isn't actually trying to accomplish anything. "Spend less than I make" is a good start, but why? Do you want to have a decent retirement account, have money for your kids to go to college, pay cash for a new car, etc.? You aren't able to break these habits, because you don't have a reason to. You aren't actually working toward anything. There's nothing you want so much that you are willing to give up the day to day splurges to have it.

Great question 
 
1) I want the comfort and security of having 3 months worth of 100% of my expenses stored away in an emergency fund. 
 
2) I want to have regular savings built up to have the ability to take my kids on a nice vacation once per year, and to have other little vacations with them once in a while, go do fun stuff, sometimes free, sometimes expensive. Just have that capability without using a credit card and without draining any little savings I have. 
 
3) I'd like to have some car security like to be able to budget/save enough to afford to buy a decent car. I'm still driving a 2002 beater and I don't know how much life it has left.  
 
 
That's about it. Retirement account ok but doesn't really motivate me, I guess it should. College, meh. They can pay for it.  
 
The key to these is increasing income, getting rid of debt, then building up savings way up. 3 months emergency fund would be 12k. Nice sized savings 6k. Then I could go on a up to 1k vacation and spend 1k on clothes for me and kids, buy nice clothes for once, then replenish the 2k throughout the year. I literally have two pair of pants that fit me and one pair of shorts. Car I don't know, not sure how that's even possible. I'll probably just buy used again, but even with that I need to build up a car fund account.

My gross monthly pay minus federal income tax, social security, and medicare, is 4950. It's correct. I'm not double dipping. But I can see how you assumed that given the numbers I posted. 
 
The alternative way, the way you want, is to say my net monthly income is 4520 and I'd remove Health Insurance from my budget. To me that is "hiding" health insurance which is an expense. I prefer to keep it listed in there.

I moved the lawn expense and gym expense to the "Spending" category. Not sure if I'd already done that in this thread but it wasn't updated like that in my spreadsheet. Now it is. Here's a snapshot of October. I think this is the most simplified I can get with the categories. Netflix and Google Music have been cancelled, service ends end of this month. Lawn and Gym maybe. I've already made a billion promises about the lawn stuff earlier in this thread so I'm not going to comment about it again until I change something. 
 
So short-term goals are still: 
- From Oct15-&gt;Oct31, I said spend no more than $200-250. Giraffe said $350. Giraffe probably knew 200-250 wasn't going to be possible. I'll still aim for the 250 number. 
- November, keep the "Spending" under $1000. Keep the Google doc updated so I can check it in a second from anywhere. 
- Continue to put $250/month into emergency fund and throw all extra cash at the Visa card.

Subtract the restaurants, vacation, and netflix/google, my "Spending" would only be at $669 right now as of 10/20! Hell. Ok. Even more simplified: In November don't eat out and don't go on a vacation! How easy is that?
 
 
      

 
 
Mango no worries. I love doing that stuff with my kids. Swimming, playing basketball, walking, going to the park and playing soccer, playing on the playground. They have 6 cousins near their age local so we hang out with them some. I got my 8 year old running with me and got a free used jogging stroller so if my 4 year old gets tired she can hop in there. We're gonna work up to a mile, then a 5k eventually.  
 
I've had the Mint app for a long time but never found a whole lot of use for it aside from checking balances.

...create a budget.... 
 </blockquote></div>
 
Thank you. I read the budget link you posted and re-evaluated what I thought was my "budget". I use Excel, I've always used Excel. As others have mentioned in the past I didn't really have a budget as you stated, I just had a list of categories and entered what I spent with each receipt throughout the month and offered a "post-mortem" of sorts. So this morning I looked closely at what I expect to earn in November and where I expect to put every cent of it so that it balances. And I created a worksheet to do the same in December. In 2018 I can try doing it for the entire year month by month but for now I just need to focus on November and get it right.  
 
How does this look?

Sorry for the ugly copy and paste. It's not perfect. I should be breaking down the "1000" spending into different categories, but that's what I've done in the past. Trying something new. I should be budgeting 75 to put into savings towards December's water bill, and could/should be putting 200-300 towards future car purchase. I just want to get this Visa card down to 0 before doing that.

Phone posting so I didn’t add up all your numbers, but what’s your plan for paying the auto insurance in January? I know nothing is due now, but are you going to budget $600 all in one month? 
 
Also, if December is going to be more than 75, I would suggest putting November towards it to smooth out expenses. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
Yeah that was the plan. I want to get rid of this Visa credit card balance before doing smart stuff like that.  
 
But fine. I'll throw $100 towards auto insurance due in Feb and $75 towards next month's water bill into separate account. Eventually I need to get to the point of the YNAB Rule #4 making my entire month's income pay for NEXT month's expenses.  
 
Auto Ins plan; 100 Nov, 100 Dec, 100 Jan, 300 Feb 
 
Also forgot my cell phone was changed to a $30/month pre-paid, but I'll still have another ~$50 due in November for the post-paid account that is now cancelled but still owe some for October's usage. 
 
How is this? Added Actual so it can be an actual budget. Am I starting to do this correctly finally?

I'm thinking about Christmas and daughter's birthday in January. Going to keep it simple. I can't afford to make a mountain of wrapped presents under the tree like last year. This year my kids will be with their mom for Christmas morning so I'm sure she'll do that. 
 
1) Child1 - Christmas - Running Watch/Activity Tracker. I think she would really like this. We talked about it a month ago. I just need something very basic for her and that will fit her small wrist. I'm seeing this for sale on Amazon for $70 so that might do. Garmin is good. <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/145621/pn/010-01241-22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/1...pn/010-01241-22</a> 
2) Child2 - Christmas - Bike. I already started looking and I see tons of bikes on craigslist/offerup for $50 and under. 
3) Christmas Tree. Tradition. Take the kids and buy a real tree. Will get a small one for $30. 
4) Stuffed stockings. Tradition, fun to do. Maybe $30. 
5) Child2 - Birthday. Going to ask my dad if he still has his hook-up for pony rides. $0. Invite friends over. Ride ponies for an hour. Get a cake $20. Open presents from other people. He did it a year or two ago and horses are my daughter's favorite thing in the world. Ex can handle getting "goodie bags" for the invited friends. I don't do that nonsense. 
 
All that for $200? It looks doable on paper. What am I forgetting? 
 
*edit* 
6) Secret Santa thing my mom's side of family started doing two years ago. Works much better than having everyone buy gifts for 8 drat kids which is insane. $25 limit. 
 
All that for $225? It looks doable on paper. What am I forgetting?

Hell yeah! Self-propelled! I bought it brand spanking new when I moved in here and mowed the poo poo myself for 2-3 years. JFC indeed. 
 
I'm just gonna mow the poo poo quick every 2 weeks and not worry about doing a meticulous job with it like I used to. I can't stand wasting half my Saturday on that poo poo like I used to. gently caress edging and weed eating, my grass can grow out on the street.
 
 
   

 
 
I've never had the blade sharpened. Who sharpens the blade?  
 
Half my Saturday... well I was 50 lbs heavier back then and very out of shape. So it probably won't affect me as much now. Also by half my Saturday I meant trimming trees and and just doing other outside maintenance stuff like cleaning the pool as well. But I was just very slow. 
 
Oh, and I have a weed whacker. It's horrible.

1. You do not need to buy your daughter a $70 tracking device. You can buy her a knockoff for much cheaper. It is a REALLY GREAT IDEA AND I THINK YOU ARE WONDERFUL FOR DOING IT but you do not need to spend $70. 
 
2. Used bike is good. Your second child is 4? Is it an adjustable bike she can use for another couple years? If not, I would hold out until you find one that is.  
 
3. The gently caress you buy a small tree for $30. Put a piece of trimmed scrap cardboard on the wall, or a piece of butcher paper, or a 99 cent piece of posterboard. Get some poster paint and paint markers at the dollar store. Make a tray out of tinfoil or use a pie plate. Dip kiddie hands, make handprints in a tree shape. Use dollar store items like glitter, stickers, stick-on earrings to make the decorations. BOOM, almost-free-rear end tree that you can treasure literally forever. 
 
4. Yeah, cool, my family always did this, but not $30 each. Assuming they already have stockings or you pick them up at Dollar Tree, you can stuff them for less than $30. Pack of ten pencils? Five in each. Extra Halloween candy? Split that poo poo in half and fill the toes. My parents always did a stocking for my brother and I, and they were never filled with anything that cost money. Like a pack of AA batteries, maybe. 
 
5. This is a great idea! 
 
6. Cool, $10 Starbucks gift card. $25 limit is not something you are obligated rise to. If anyone looks askance, gently caress THEIR STUPID rear end. They have no class. 
 
 
e: You are potentially forgetting wrapping paper and ribbon. Again, make your own with your girls- newspaper or parchment/butcher paper, cut a kitchen sponge into a tree shape, give them some paint and go to town. Other than that, I don't see hidden expenses.

So here's the thing that might help you with your budgeting mindset - 
 
if you want to spent $225 on Christmas, great!  
 
But where is that $225 coming from? You need to cut money from some other spending categories to afford it, and you only have 2 months really to do it. So $125 less in November and in December, and you now can have this kind of Christmas.  
<b>If you can't make that saving or find that money, you can't have that kind of Christmas.</b> That's what you need to get your head around 
 
No lawn cost (80), no restaurant (83,25,91,49,90,15) - thats $308 - I'm not sure where these figures are from (I grabbed them from <a href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3827922&amp;userid=0&amp;perpage=20&amp;pagenumber=17#post477574500" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://forums.somethingawful.com/s...7#post477574500</a>) but you get the idea 
  </blockquote></div>
 
 
 
I get it. That is the mindset I need to get into. Earlier in thread someone posed question as to why I want to adhere to a budget, why do I want to spend less, what is the goal... my response only involved long-term goals. This is the kind of thing that is short-term and immediate. CUT SPENDING OR I CAN'T HAVE A NICE CHRISTMAS FOR MY KIDS. That is motivating. 
 
 
What I've done so far and where the $225 will come from: 
 
- $80 lawn service cancelled 
- $30 saved off monthly cell phone 
- $10 netflix cancelled 
- $10 music cancelled 
- $16 saved off monthly internet service 
- Cut monthly aftercare expense in half from $234 to $117 
- Restaurant expense averaged $260 over the past 3 months (Aug $163 + Sep $248 + Oct $369 = 780 / 3 = $260).  
 
 
I'm going to keep the $21 monthly gym discretionary expense. I'll have to fit it in.

what do you guys make of this? my past 24 months of electricity usage. I use the electric company's "budget billing" so they try to even out the bills over the course of the year. This year it finally got consistent around the 150 mark. I've done a LITTLE better this year about keeping usage down and adjusting the AC, but still lot of room for improvement. how does my usage compare to you guys? 4 bedroom house under 2k sq ft with pool. January 2017 puzzles me. I must have cranked up the pool heater a lot that month.

That's reasonable for your size house in Florida. You need a smaller house without a pool. 3 people don't need 2k square feet. I don't remember how old your oldest is, but they're probably at the age where changing schools next year won't really matter, so keep it in mind as a longer term plan. 
 </blockquote></div>
 
"Need" is really the question here. How many sq ft does a person REALLY "need"? I mean those tiny homes are &lt; 500 sq ft and they look pretty comfy.  
 
But yeah I agree. There is one room in my house we rarely ever go into. Can go weeks without utilizing the room for anything. I need to do something about that. 
 
 
 
 
Yes I have a pool heater. It's nearing end of October and I haven't used it yet. But it's cooling down. I'll have to run my girls around and get hot before going in. Any water temp under 82 F is "FREEZING". I went in this weekend, water temp 81 F, felt great.
 
 
   

 
 
I feel like we've gone over the pool heater 
Maybe in previous thread 
Anyway, I wish I knew how much it costs when I run it. Maybe if I ran it a LOT it would be an extra... $50?
 
 
    

 
 
hell yes Droo, I'll get that info. 
 
no chance it's as expensive as yours, but mine doesn't sound as powerful either as it heats about 1 degree F every 45 mins or so 
 
there have been some months I ran it A LOT and look at my FPL bills. If we look at Nov16 thru Mar17 as a good indicator, Id say peak usage in Jan 17 up to about $75, which is a ton. I know I used it a lot that month.  
 
i'll get the stats
 
 
    

 
 
1) Electric pool heater 
 
2) 110,000 BTUs 
 
3) Pool size is 9,000 gallons 
 
4) Cost per kWh ranges between $0.09086 to $0.11086 per kWh depending how much I use. Let's just call it $0.10000.
 
 
    

 
 
Devian, so how much would it cost if let's say I ran the pool heater for 100 hours per year? How many thousand dollars?
 
 
  

 
 
Droo, is Colin's math accurate there?  
So if I went crazy with it and actually ran it for 100 hours it would be $330.  
In 2017 so far I've run it for somewhere in the 30-40 hour range. 
Very helpful thank you
 
 
     

 
 
Agreed 
I can't afford anything extra
 
 
   

 
 
Yes it's a heat pump. This is it, the HI-110: 
<a href="http://www.gulfstreamheatpump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GulfStream-HI-2017-Broshure-Front.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gulfstreamheatpump.com/w...shure-Front.pdf</a> 
 
60 cents per hour? This just keeps getting better and better. I mean it makes sense if you look at my monthly kWh usage. A/C is the #1 killer.  
 
Next project: Get all my ceiling fans working and kick the A/C temp up a couple degrees. None of the 5 fans are working right now. I hate fans in general but I know that would help make it more comfortable if I raised the A/C temp.
 
 
      

 
 
Droo, no... no, and no. Also no. 
 
god why did I mention the stupid heater and A/C. please let it die. or am I just being trolled.

You have a couple people mocking you for a luxury item when you are in consumer debt, at least one person saying it's not a big deal, and in the process you hopefully have a better sense of how much it costs to run your pool heater. I don't really understand your reaction.  
 
Whether you run it or not is up to you... if you want to spend $40 or whatever the amount is to heat it up 10 degrees for a week during spring break that doesn't sound unreasonable to me. I certainly wouldn't just leave it on by default though. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
Gotcha. And thanks for the heat pump math. Good to know exactly what it costs. Agreed, I've never left it on by default or overnight.  
I'll just focus on other outside activities as it gets cooler. The pool can wait till summer. You know the crazy thing? The water actually gets too hot in the middle of summer. 100+F outside and jumping in 90+F water is not very refreshing. 
I'll love to just fill the thing up, sell the pool equipment, and have more space in the back. Then we might go to the beach more. 
 
 
Ah, one thing that comes to mind though, as it gets cooler, reduce the # of hours the pool pump runs! Save $$.
 
 
  

 
 
...You guys are really hammering away on this pool heater in Florida luxury. (the lawn expense is gone)
 
 
  

 
 
I need to re-read the whole thread. Droo's been dropping excellent advice the whole time.

Depending on the various features your pool has, you could save a chunk of electricity cost by managing the pump a little better. Variable speed pumps are much more efficient at low speeds than high speeds, so if you don't have a reason to run the pump at high RPM (rooftop solar, floor cleaner etc) you should run it for longer at a lower speed. <b>It also doesn't need to run as often when the water is cold - I don't know how cold your water gets in the winter, but I run my pump for 8 hours in the summer and like 3 hours in the winter when the water temp is under 50.</b> 
 
There are some relatively easy things you can do to improve the efficiency of your house - check all the weather stripping around doors looking for bad seals, make sure the furnace filter is replaced often enough, cut some foam board insulation and use it to put a layer or two on any attic hatches you have that are currently not insulated. Hang thermal drapes over windows, check all the plastic flaps in exhaust fans to make sure they open and close correctly, obviously install LED bulbs and I think they make retrofit kits that semi seal into an existing can light if yours has holes in it so that less air escapes, re-caulk around windows if you see a problem, have additional insulation blown into your attic. 
 </blockquote></div>
 
 
     

 
 
OK is there any room to reduce my regular fixed expenses? I know the focus is on my discretionary spending but if anyone has ideas please share what you've done at home to reduce these. I know selling my house and moving to a small apartment would be the big fix and I may get to that point but want to see what I can optimize here first. 
 
Electric: $150 
- Don't run the pool heater! 
- Reduce # of hours the pool pump runs when it's cooler 
- Get ceiling fans working, use them, raise the A/C temp 
- A/C temp now is usually 82 during the day, 79 when we get home, turned down to 77 at night when we sleep. If I'm by myself w/o kids, I regularly keep it at 79-80. 
- I DO have two refrigerators! Main one in my kitchen, secondary in the laundry room. Should I unplug one of them? I mean I really don't NEED two. How much does a fridge use? 
- What about my attic? How much of a difference does that make in a home? It's scorching hot up there in the summer. Droo said "additional insulation blown into your attic", is that costly and will it make a difference? I don't think there is much insulation up there if I recall. 
- Thermal drapes over windows? Expensive?  
- Filters I keep current. Weather stripping around doors are good. Windows are good, new and professionally installed. 
 
 
Water: $75 
- I recently changed my sprinkler system to run 1 day per week instead of the 2 days per week it was running. 
- The most recent bill was $130 for 2 month period, so down to $65/month. But that included Hurricane Week downtime. 
- What else can I do to use less water?

Sure, you could sell your house and move into a 2br apartment. That'd probably save a lot of money! Can't say I'd do it myself if I were in your situation, though.

It is becoming more and more tempting.  
 
In theory: 
Sell house for 325k, payoff 250k mortgage, 23k sale fees, 6k personal loan, 4k credit card = 42k CASH IN THE BANK 
 
 
Comparing current expenses vs projected change in a move from 4br house to 2br apartment rental: 
 
HOME 
Current: Mortgage and escrowed home owners insurance and property tax $1750 
New: Did quick search for 2/2 apartments for rent in this zip code, same school district; 
$1600 - 2/2 935 sq ft 
$1350 - 2/2 950 sq ft 
$1450 - 2/2 920 sq ft 
$1450 - 2/2 935 sq ft 
 
ELECTRIC 
Current: $150  
New: Should come down a bit. maybe $100 average? 
 
WATER 
Current: $75  
New: $0 included with rent 
 
 
SAVINGS: $525/month (rent if I got the $1350/mo apartment... $400 saved, electric $50 saved, water $75 saved) 
 
PLUS... I don't have to fix all the broken poo poo! Fridge compressor dies? Dryer needs a new part? Roof needs replacement? $0 compared to hundreds-thousands. 
 
 
 
What am I missing? Renter's insurance? Other fees I'm forgetting?  
 
 
 
 
None of these would change: 
-------------- 
Health insurance + dental + vision: $430 
Internet: $40-something 
Cell Phone: $30 
TV: $0 
Child1 pre-k/aftercare: $240 
Child2 aftercare: $117 
Auto Insurance: $100 
Discretionary $
 
 
   

 
 
I mean drat what am I forgetting? Why am I keeping this house? 
 
Concluding from the above: 
- I put 42k in the bank to do stuff with - fully stock the emergency fund, start up an IRA, have money in savings for when I need to replace car, etc. 
- Plus each month I have an extra ~$500 to put directly into savings for vacations, be able to buy some nicer clothes for a change, etc.  
- Maybe even start a college fund, get the Florida Prepaids going
 
 
    

 
 
All good points, thank you. 
 
ACTION PLAN: Continue focus on finishing out October budget strong. Adhere to Nov and Dec budgets. Re-evaluate house sale in January.

I hear ya. I'm pretty flexible with living situations though.  
 
It pains me to think if my ex would've bought-in to my "go debt free" plan back in 2010 or whenever it was (it's in an old thread), I'd have had my old condo mortgage paid off completely and her student loan paid off completely and be completely debt free as of something like 2013/2014. Then ~3 years since then with no mortgage/no debt just banking cash every month with dual incomes.  
 
But the old condo was only 1200 sq ft and my ex wanted a house. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/safs/smilies/4/1/shrug.001.gif" title=":shrug:"/> Gotta live in the now and not dwell on that.
 
 
    

 
 
315 sq ft is plenty for 1 person. Or even a couple. Adding multiple kids I think would be tough.

Oh wow that sounds bad. My kids would love a dog but no thanks I can't deal with that right now and they're expensive and I don't think I'm cut out to be a good dog owner. 
 
Yeah right now I'm living situation is:

It's just a ridiculous amount of space.
 
 
     

 
 
Steph, nah I don't live that far south.  
 
That's an idea. 
 
Or I could rent out the master bed/bath for a year with shared access to kitchen/living room.  
Or I could live with my mom for a year and rent the entire house out. 
Or I could sell it. 
Or I could stick with the current plan. 
Or I could agree to get back together with ex-gf and tell her she should move in with me when her lease is up and live happily ever after until zaurg thread #5.

Sounds like it is way more house than you need. Unless you have a clear strategic plan it doesn't seem to make much sense keeping it.

Personal anecdote- I lived with my two kids in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment for 6 months after my divorce. Shared custody (50/50). My kids were both in the 12-8 yo range. poo poo sucked when they were there, but a mansion when they weren’t. I’d say think long and hard about how the kids interact, if they need personal space, and what milestones come up during your lease. Sometimes kids just want space from each other and if they don’t get it, it becomes a bigger problem.

Went to grocery store tonight. Really trying to focus on true needs, but wish I didn't have to go tonight. Seems like 4 grocery store trips in past 2 weeks is a lot.  
 
BUT... doing much better compared to previous months. Take Aug and Sep for example to compare.  
 
Just need to keep this up and I'll be doing well. Restaurants are 100% unnecessary. Buy good food, eat good food. This is not a temporary change aka fad diet, this is a change in behavior, a change of way of life. The fridge, freezer, and cupboard have plenty of food.

Thanks guys. Good suggestions. I certainly have options... these grocery stores plus another 2-3 local markets are all within ~6 miles from me. I seem to end up relying on Publix the most though out of convenience - it's the closest. Out of all these the only one I haven't been to is Aldi. 
 
Publix 
Costco 
Wal-Mart 
Target 
Whole Foods 
Aldi 
Trader Joe's 
Fresh Market 
Winn-Dixie 
 
 
When you guys say meal planning, are you talking about cooking a whole bunch of food on Sunday and freezing some to last the entire week?
 
 <span>zaurg fucked around with this message at Oct 27, 2017 around 16:19</span>
      

 
 
Gotcha. I kinda loosely do that in my head for 1-2 nights in advance, never done the whole week. Here is a quick stab at the next 5 nights w/ my kids: 
 
10/27 - Dinner provided w/ other family 
10/28 - Defrost chicken for Sunday. Lunch: Sandwiches, fruit, yogurt. Early Dinner: Pasta w/ meat &amp; veggie. Pack bag to eat on way to outing. Have leftovers at home for late night if needed. 
10/29 - Lunch: Pasta leftovers. Dinner: Grilled chicken, rice, veggie. 
10/30 - Dinner: leftover chicken/rice/veggie 
10/31 - Candy
 
 
    

 
 
Got it. 
 
I Put a notepad in kitchen with next 5 days of meals. Writing them out there. Yes agreed, planning it out prevents the 5:30pm "crap i'll just order pizza" snap decisions:
 
 
    

 
 
I am on the verge of financial collapse. drat I should've taken this action when I first started this thread back in July and I'd be in much better shape right now.  
 
checking account balance ~1500 
savings balance ~1250 
credit card debt ~3700 
 
Not a good feeling. Going to fix this and not come back to this low point.

I've been very consistent since 10/15. Happy with the progress. Taking into consideration $ first and the fact that I can't afford poo poo.  
 
Went to kid's event tonight and everyone else was paying $25 for parking. I found a place 3 blocks farther for $13 and found a promo code online to knock it down to $8.50. So walk a tiny bit and parking for $8.50. Then at the event I purchased nothing for the first time ever. Sporting event and no food/drink. It was easy, because I can't afford $8 beers and crazy poo poo like that. Still had a blast watching my kid. 
 
3 days left to finish off October. Anxious to start tackling the November budget. Also Saturday Nov 4th lawn will be mowed in record speed!
 
 
    

 
 
It's killing me that I can't afford to go to next Saturday's Miami vs Virginia Tech 8pm game. Could get a ticket and parking for ~70. But I can't afford that, damnit! Motivation to fix this mess.

If you end up $70 under your October target, feel free to go. Sticking it in savings would be great too, but I'm more concerned about you falling into the trap of manic spending deprivation to try to fix your situation as quickly as possible than I am about you maxing your savings rate right now. You've tried that before, several times, and always ended up worse off in the long run. 
 
For the rest of November, just focus on learning to keep your cumulative spending number in mind so you know where you're at all month. Yes, you need to trim your overall spending long term, but that's only going to happen if you know how to keep track of your spending as part of your daily life, which takes practice. Trying to not spend anything all will not help develop those habits. It's the dieting equivalent of switching from junk food to celery and tap water.  
 
Just live your life, make sensible decisions and don't let yourself spend more than that $1000 limit. If that feels too easy, good. It should be easy. It hasn't been until now, though, so don't get ahead of yourself. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
Not going to be under the October target due to not setting and working towards the target until 10/15. After 10/15 I think I've been doing well.  
 
I don't think I'm doing a manic spending deprivation. I think at this rate it *should* be easy but I'm worried about how to tackle unexpected larger expenses like car repairs and home repairs. One of those could easily crush my attempt at staying under $1k for "spending" for the month.

Nov spending tracking:

Giraffe you're good at this.  
 
So since 10/15 I added what I spent to the Google Doc at least every 48 hours but usually every 24 hours. So I knew what I'd spent - at the end of every 24/48 hour period. I added the visa and amex credit card interest just because they came up towards the end of the month. So no they really didn't belong on this list since that's just penalty for past expenses. Without the cc interest I've spent $318.93 since 10/15.  
 
Overall I just tried to keep my spending low and I thought I did that.  
 
I am changing my behavior, in response to keeping track of the $, but perhaps not to the level of what you're talking about. I don't know how else to do it. Maybe those of you who have suggested cash might be the best way. If I start with an envelope of cash and can literally physically see and count what I have left before completing any transaction, that will help? To me that sounds more like the "manic deprivation" Giraffe keeps referring to. I think if I was using 100% cash I would've spent the exact same amount since 10/15 because I consciously thought with each purchase whether I really needed it or not and thought about how it would affect the budget. To me 10/15-10/30 has been a success but it's only two drat weeks. November is the real test.  
 
 
*edit*  
Also, 10/15-10/30 we just picked an arbitrary number (250, 350, whatever) that didn't have much meaning to an actual budget so I didn't give that exact number much value to be honest. 
That's why I say November is the real test where the number is a true number I need to stick to or then I'm spending more than I earn.

My next major issue is my car. It's sounding pretty rough. Due for an oil change. Check Engine light has been on for a while again. It has a slow coolant leak. Increased vibration in front of car lately. I know next to nothing about how to fix cars.

No... no man. I don't. I mean, I have the $1000 spending budget for November. That's my only budget. Simple.

NOVEMBER OLD CAR FIX CHALLENGE 
 
This car only has 50k miles. I need to get it running nice and I should be able to keep it for a few more years.
 
 
    

 
 
Always thought the check engine lights were often meaningless on older cars, because that's how the mechanics treat them. "I turned the light off for you". The light has literally been on and off periodically for years. Last year one mechanic suggested I go get a new gas cap from auto parts store and he reset the light. 
 
Anyway I'm going to plug in this new gadget to see what codes it gives me and start troubleshooting this stuff myself. That AI subforum looks awesome.
 
 
    

 
 
I have a lot of things to fix. Driving with the check engine light is one of them. loving Nuts seems a little extreme but I'll own it.

loving hell. Went out to car now to check things and got a towel out from the trunk and the towel was soaked. Somehow my trunk got flooded.  
 
Added another item to the list above I'd forgotten to note yesterday; a whistling noise when accelerating. kind of higher pitch. whistling is the best way I can describe it. it comes and goes.

No. I just went out to car now and it's been sitting there for ~7 hours and no sign of anything leaking under the car. I looked at the coolant in reservoir and doesn't appear oily. It's getting low but not low enough to trigger the low warning light yet.

I don't think so. I'll pay closer attention and video record it.
 
 
    

 
 
Coolant is leaking along the path of the serpentine belt. I mean that's where I see the coolant. Sorry it's dark - just a quick video where you can hear the noise and see some of the spots where coolant is showing up, spraying off the serpentine belt.

"Water thrown by serpentine belt = water pump leak. Replace that sucker. " 
 
 
ok. Based on everything I've read it's gotta be the water pump.

A car you know is worth a lot more than its resale value imo. Cars are always money sinks, and you really have to think about replacement value. If a car is worth $3,000 and a hypothetical repair would be $1,500, you'll probably have a hard time finding an equivalent quality replacement for the cost of the repair, so in my mind fixing would be worth it. 
 </blockquote></div>
 
Thanks. Many things to consider. That's the attitude I had ~17 years ago when my shiny new (used) Nissan Altima was totaled in accident and the insurance company from the guy who hit me paid off my auto loan (~10k balance remaining) and gave me about $500 towards a new car. I was like thanks but now I'm hosed without a car. Sure they compensated me for the loss of the car but they didn't replace my car or the down payment I'd have to shell out to get a new one. 
 
I hope this thing isn't $1500 though because I can't pay that. I mean at worst it's the water pump for a few hundred bucks right
 
 
     

 
 
I ran home from the mechanic this morning and then walked to work. I prefer this over having a car.
 
 
  

 
 
Not intending on crossposting everything in AI/BFC, but this particular part is $$ related so, what do you guys think?  
 
- I brought to the shop this morning requesting simply to have coolant leak investigated and to have an oil change done. They just called me back. The damage: Water Pump is bad and the cause of leak. They say when they do a job like this often the thermostat doesn't close so they need to replace that as well. Plus I got an oil change done. $118 for parts, 3 hours labor, Total $494. 
 
- This is from the #1 rated shop on Yelp 
 
- They said they can't do it today, too busy. Can bring car back Monday. In meantime they did the oil change and topped off the coolant.
 
 
      

 
 
n8r - They claim all the noises are related to the water pump. Paid $26 for oil change today. So it would be $468 next week to get the water pump and thermostat replaced, to fix the leak and noises. This weekend I'll access the maintenance guide and check off what has been done over the past ~4-5 years since I bought the car and will see what's left to tackle and when I can reasonably get them done.  
 
 
Looking at the entire month of November and my spending budget. Very hopeful outlook below... trying to make the water pump fix fit into the November budget without pulling money out of emergency fund:

Holy moly! <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/safs/smilies/0/a/eyepop.001.gif" title=":eyepop:"/> 
 
I've got one more suggestion for you: don't go bananas trying to cut your spending to the absolute bone. Yes, you hosed up your October spending with that $771 vacation, but the rest of your discretionary is fine so far. To get back on track is not going to take insane financial self-denial, it's going to take learning how to manage your spending decisions. Don't financially yo-yo diet, you know it doesn't work for you. 
 
Here are the goals I'd like to see you hit before you go too crazy: 
 
1. Pick a number for the rest of October, I don't care what it is, and keep your spending under that. $300, $500, it doesn't matter, just make it realistic. Then do not exceed it for anything less than a true emergency. 
 
2. Spend less than $1000 in discretionary in November. No excuses, just do it. Use this as your first real dry run for how to live within your means. Every dollar you spend in one place is a dollar you don't have to spend in another.  
 
Then just get through Christmas without bankrupting yourself and see where you are heading into 2018. Maybe you find more cuts, maybe you identify a couple of areas (e.g. groceries) and just focus on getting the most bang for your buck from what you do spend. Take it slow, don't let mistakes push you into just giving up, but hold yourself accountable when you spend money, not just when you tally up the damage. 
      </blockquote></div>
 
 
Quoting for reminder 
 
Not cutting spending to the bone, just a thorough trim. 
 
October 15th-&gt;31st was a quick trial run in which I spent $318.93. It was a successful trimming, but not a success in picking a # and sticking to it.  
 
November - no excuses - $1000 or less.
 
 
  

 
 
I run for fun. An ocean of suffering sounds about right. Careful with that <img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-lsd.gif" title=":lsd:"/> though, dude.
 
 
  

 
 
Yes I'm aware of Thanksgiving. Can't wait. Go to moms or sisters and eat a feast and I bring pies. 
 
It's definitely possible I left out a grocery trip. I only have $195 total for grocery store which doesn't seem possible. Hard to plan out the whole month. 
 
Also I might do my little bit of Christmas shopping towards end of this month though. Keeping an eye out for deals on bike and watch.

The water pump should not come out of the $1000, IMO. The odds of you spending less than $530 in November are zero, which means you’re again not actually doing the exercise. Track the categories we talked about and practice keeping a cumulative tally in your head. Don’t let that tally exceed $1k. That’s it.

It's going well. Amazing how much lower my grocery receipts are over this past month when focusing on getting just what we need and selecting the cheaper brands and sale items. Why spend $0.50 more on a can of kidney beans? Just get the store brand. That stuff adds up. Making a huge pot of chili this weekend. 
 
Currently on pace for less than $400 spent at the grocery store this month and no stops at restaurants. You can follow my spending day to day on the Google doc, it's very exciting, click here:

Update:  
 
$26 = Oil change completed on 11/3 for $26. Fit into November's $1k spending budget. 
 
$374 = Coolant leak, service engine light, and ALL that noise fixed by replacing water pump and thermostat, completed on 11/13 for $374, beating the first two quotes I got of $450 and $468, and in the process hopefully found a good trustworthy mechanic for the future. Ran into neighbor at grocery store who referred me to another neighbor who has run a local auto repair business for ~15 years and has great reviews for good work and fair price. Bonus only 1 mile away from home/work. Withdraw from Emergency Fund to cover this. 
 
Next up, fix the passenger door myself. Buy part and youtube it. Targeting to do in December. 
 
Next up, locate maintenance plan for car per manufacturer and fill out what has been done and what should be coming up within the next 3-12 months.

Aside from the trolling posts, I would be in such amazing shape right now if I'd just listened to BFC years ago. I know this. Not necessarily every little single thing, but the big ticket items. No ragrets, just learning from mistakes going forward.

I looked up the door check, it looks pretty simple. Different than any German car I've worked on, but not too bad at all. Go slow on the clips on the lower door sill trim. The design looks more solid than the older European stuff but I'm sure it'll put up a little fight.

Thanks. From 10/10 to 11/14, these are my only "restaurant" spendings. The drinks on 11/5 were at a friend's memorial party and got a couple beers. Today daughter talked me into getting her school lunch pizza which I used to do weekly now maybe just once a month. It really hasn't been that difficult. Just a change in thinking - I need to make all meals, no big deal.

In comparison, here is 9/10 to 10/9. Granted some of these were vacation restaurant splurges but wow. $598.84. Christ. Barely any of these were memorable... the only one that was great was a fun happy hour at Stratosphere Hotel's Skylounge in Vegas. The rest should've been replaced with home cooked meals. 6 in the list below were fast food. I don't want to go back to this.

Keeping a daily eye on budget! 
 
On pace to spend $715 out of my $1000 "spending" budget. 8 days left. I splurged twice over the past few days including one of the dumbest things to spend money on because of the ~1000% markup... beer at a football game. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-ohdear.png" title=":ohdear:"/> 
 
On pace for: 
327 Groceries 
126 Entertainment, Restaurants 
88 Christmas and Thanksgiving related (gift, tree, food) 
56 Credit card interest charge from prior month's spending and carried over balance 
53 Auto - gas 
26 Auto - oil change 
21 Gym 
15 Haircut
 
 
    

 
 
Well I didn't spend any money on tickets/parking... and it was raining like crazy at the game so I was not even in my seat for a quarter and bored as hell... and my friend bought first round... and I bought second... and and and and... excuses excuses excuses... BWM!!!!!!

Happy with how November went. It's only one month but it's a start. It's the only way to move forward. What I was doing before is not sustainable. This month might be the first time since I got divorced that I spent less than I earned. It's very encouraging to know it's possible 
 
November 2017  
 
Income 5026 used as follows: 
 
250 into emergency fund 
305 into 401k 
 
I spent 374 on car which I took out of emergency fund balance. The efund balance was 1500, now it's 1126.  
 
Spent 2882 on "regular" expenses consisting of: 
Mortgage 1750 
Insurance 454 
Utilities 296 
Childcare 382 
 
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/emot-10bux.gif" title=":10bux:"/> <b>Spent 792 on all discretionary expenses (Grocery, Gas, Gym, etc.). My goal was to stay under 1000. These are all itemized here:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/emot-10bux.gif" title=":10bux:"/>

Paid 100 towards personal loan. 
Paid 547 towards Visa credit card balance. 
Put 150 into savings towards future Auto Insurance payment and next month's water bill 
balance = 0 
 
IF I didn't have the personal loan or any credit balance, this month would've looked like this even including the 374 spent on car repair: 
EARNED 5026

Also want to add to keep in my memory, this past week had a little bit of a breakthrough. I had a cold and was feeling crappy and was late getting out of work and late picking up the kids from aftercare and after school sports. It was just a frustrating day. The exact kind of day that 100% of the time the past I would be headed straight to drive-through dinner. I went home and made dinner. Because that's the only option when you have over 3k in credit card debt. There is NO MONEY AVAILABLE to splurge on restaurants!  
 
 
On to December... 
 
Spending tracking: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f3OcZFtC8vAgqBpZnfruASdS0LY4T2_jy3mWf3BP2nE/edit#gid=443221788" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet...t#gid=443221788</a> 
I like this method. It allows me to plug in expenses in advance I know I'm going to have to help project the full month. Then it's a quick look to see my balance.  
 
Budget looks like this 
<img alt="" border="0" class="timg" src="https://i.imgur.com/3oDZjZv.png"/> 
 
 
Goals:  
1) In December I want to update spreadsheet for tracking these like I used to: 
- Debt Mortgage balance 
- Debt Personal Loan balance 
- Debt Credit card balance 
- Asset Emergency Fund balance 
- Asset 401k balance 
- Asset Home estimated value 
- Net Worth 
 
2) Keep attacking Credit Card balance until it's 0. Then I can figure out if it's better to save more or pay more towards the 5% personal loan. 
3) Keep balance in life. No restaurants, but not extreme spending withholding. Stick to the budget. Keep running. Have fun. 
4) Make a good goal post in the BFC 2018 Financial Goals thread. 
5) Um... so I broke up with girlfriend in October and that was a good decision $$-wise. When I decide to start dating again, meet someone who has similar goals and doesn't mind good home cooked meals most of the time. I think I'm just not going to date for a while as that is an automatic increase to spending which I really can't afford right now. Nor do I have time for it right now. 
 
Thanks guys
 
 
    

 
 
I really want to knock out this credit card balance. Above I said I'd put 374 into emergency fund to cover what I took out last month. I think I'd be smarter to just put the normal 250 and put the rest towards the credit card balance.  
 
With payment towards it tonight I got the visa credit card balance under 3k!  
 
2901 balance 
 
It's killing me. I want it gone. I have 1765 combined in my emergency fund and my kids custodial savings accounts. Maybe I should just throw it all at it this week? Then I'd have balance down to 1136 and could get it under 1k by end of month, and probably knock it out in January. Then I could restore the efund and custodial accounts quicker  
 
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/u/adminuploads/smileys/sludgepal.gif" title=":sludgepal:"/>
 
 
    

 
 
Chicken, you're right. I'm not going to touch the custodial accounts. My kids are young and don't even know it's there, but it's their money. My dad did that when I was a kid and I don't want to do it to mine. 
 
Devian, all right. I need to figure out exactly what my personal loan balance is. With a quick calc it looks like around $6,068 
 
Regarding eliminating credit card debt you're right there are two ways; Trim Discretionary and/or Make More Money 
 
Trimming discretionary... man November was a good month for me. I spent 403 at grocery store and zero restaurants? That is unheard of for me. And I'll continue doing that. Here is the 792 in November itemized. 
- I underlined the items I REALLY could have cut out... $58 
- I bolded the items that I could cut but they were important to me so I did them. $115.44 
 
I need to make more money!

Yes I was able to track headroom every day and made decisions on what I had remaining. 
 
No slack. I realize I can't control everything but some things I can like spending on discretionary stuff. So no slack there.

MOTIVATION -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
My kids are with their mom this weekend and I'd have loved to have $500 available to escape for the weekend to Charlotte, NC. But I don't! Gotta zero out this credit card balance and build savings - THEN I can afford to do that poo poo once in a while without just piling on the credit card.
 
 
    

 
 
Thanks Mainframe! The bar is set low, have no choice but to nail these simple goals. Then start raising the bar.

BFC what should I do with my old fat clothes? Finally went through closet after 1.5 years of losing weight. Closet was pretty packed now it's nice and simple and clean.

Thank you. Good tips. I used Mint tonight to add all my accounts, even an old bit of stock my aunt gave me years ago (10 shares has turned into 17 shares, sweet!) and added my personal loan, which I found the original amoritization schedule and the current personal loan balance is $5613.

Goal: Be able to afford to go to Bermuda w/ my kids in January 2019 for the Bermuda Marathon.  
 
Possible? I can stay with family there. I'll have to price it out and set a savings goal.
 
 
    

 
 
alright alright alright. Thanks for checking me in check, BFC.  
 
5 months out is the ideal time to book a flight anyway right? So Summer 2018 I can see where I'm at and see if it's doable.
 
 
    

 
 
Quick flight check on Google Flights for August 2018 said $1800 for 1adult+2children. That's without crazy 12 hour layovers. Wow. Maybe I could hunt around and get something for closer to $1500 but still, that is more than I was imagining. Might not be doable.
 
 
  

 
 
Thanks guys, all good advice I'm taking.  
 
That marathon isn't that important. I have family in Bermuda and I've never been there. Would be a great vacation and great experience for my kids. Family has mentioned the marathon to me a couple times and offered to let us stay with them, etc. Setting it as a goal for 12+ months out I thought could be a little "carrot" as Fleta said, a goal to shoot for. 
 
Earlier in the thread I mentioned one of my goals was to improve my financial situation enough where I COULD afford to take a vacation once a year with my kids. Those experiences are the kind of stuff kids remember as they get older. Memories, etc. Anyway it doesn't have to be Bermuda that was just a quick thought the other day. Maybe 2020 is a better goal for that. 
 
 
sidenote; Each year I struggle taking enough PTO at work so that I don't lose it (only 40 hours carries over)! I still have 70 hrs balance even after scheduling the last week of Dec off. Anyone else have this problem? Goal for 2018: Schedule a week or two off in the summer and do fun local stuff with the kids instead of paying to put them in Summer camp.
 
 
      

 
 
It's a bad idea to put my normal monthly emergency fund money ($250) into bitcoin right? It went down a lot today. Four times this week at work four coworkers randomly started a conversation about bitcoin with me out of the blue (3 pro, 1 con).
 
 <span>zaurg fucked around with this message at Dec 23, 2017 around 04:01</span>
  

 
 
9 days left in the month 
 
I've spent $753 of my $1000 spending budget 
 
$282 of that on grocery. 
$231 of that on Christmas stuff. My Christmas goal on <a href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3827922&amp;userid=0&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=9#post477597752" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Page 9</a> was $225 so I'm pretty happy I about nailed that.  
$240 on other poo poo.  
 
 
$247 remaining for the last 9 days of this month. Doable. I'm not bored with this slow progress, Giraffe, despite my previous two posts about vacation planning and bitcoin gambling.
 
 
      

 
 
BFC parents, question for ya.  
 
I am giving my youngest daughter a new bike and my oldest daughter a running GPS watch. Plus they get a fully stocked stocking full of little goodies. While out doing my shopping I was certainly tempted to snag 3-4 more gifts each to just have other stuff wrapped to give them. But I stuck to the plan. 
 
I am expecting some disappointment from them with the lack of "huge mound of gifts under the tree", which they've been spoiled with for their existence thus far. Sure they will like the watch and the bike. But that's just how it'll go, I'm sure.  
 
I guess I don't know what my question is. Just typing this out helps me prepare for it. Any feedback? Tell the brats to like what they get? Have you experienced a similar situation?

Of all your options, I don't think many people in SoFla want to rent a room in a house out west. Guess the mom idea depends on your relationship. 
 
What exactly is the current plan? Refinancing was suggested but I don't believe you have acted on it? 
 
Sounds like it is way more house than you need. Unless you have a clear strategic plan it doesn't seem to make much sense keeping it.

I posted this on 3/4/2012 in thread #2. I would've been 100% debt free 18 months ago. I remember being pretty excited writing that out and ex scoffing at it. Now there is no chance at that, but at least I can get credit card to zero and personal loan to zero, but it's going to be nothing like this. Ugh 
 
 
<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote>Here are 2 options my family currently has about our future. What do you think? 
 
Option 1) 
- pay $2287 total per month towards student loan balance of 32,747 
- Student Loan balance would be 0 on June 1st, 2013 (+1 year, 3 months) 
- then as of June 1st, 2013, pay $2287 extra towards mortgage 
- Mortgage balance would be 0 on April 1st, 2016 (+2 years, 10 months) 
- at this point child would have to go into current public school district kindergarten. not a fan of the C-rated school. or try to get into a magnet/university school which is selected by lottery of some kind/luck. or pay for private school. 
- if child in free (public or the university) school, we'd have $3358 left over after expenses every month, so we could save up 40k per year.  
- save 120k in 3 years and have enough for 20% down payment on 250k home with a lot left over for emergency fund and such. 
- after new 250k home purchase, rent out condo, income $6984, expenses $4239, leaving about $2745 per month for savings/retirement/paying down mortgage. 
- "disaster plan" budget if husband (higher income) lost job would equal about : income 4753, expenses 4239, so 514 left for savings. 
 
Result: Debt free in 4 years 1 month (APRIL 2016), while utilizing the $17k in savings to maintain irregular expenses/emergency fund. Comfortable budget after buying new home. Comfort knowing we could survive on 1 main income.</blockquote></div>

More than that- it's our job as parents to help them understand the right way to deal with negative emotions like frustration and disappointment. Sheltered kids don't have those tools and end up less resilient in adulthood. In fact, barring major trauma, it's much healthier for them to experience some negative poo poo when they're young. 
 
Of course, my kid isn't even two yet so what the gently caress do I know haha. We spent two dollars on two gifts and I'm pretty sure she'll just eat the wrapping paper.

Not competitive at all from my side. Not offensive. Yes I'm sure she went all out, which is cool. That's what she does. 
 
Whoever recommended to just wrap all the little things I bought for the stockings was a great idea. imandyyo - thanks. And that article was perfect about how to better handle/prepare is perfect as well. 
 
Merry Christmas BFC 
 
Have the whole week off, plenty of running and 2018 goal-planning to do!
 
 
    

 
 
Thanks guys. This Christmas was one of the best ever and I only spent about $230. Kids loved the few things I got them and we had a great day. I prepped them ahead of time before we went to grandma's and then back home with me that "maybe they'll get some gifts and to be thankful". That idea of wrapping all the little stocking gifts I got was great... my kids loved the neon dry erase markers and glue sticks. LOL. I knew they would, they love that kind of stuff.
 
 
  

 
 
I won +$15 on fantasy football this year (spent $150, won $165). I received a $50 gift from family.  
 
Do I have to add this sudden huge windfall of money to "income" in my budget?

Dwight I hear you on all points. Maybe running is enough emotional gratification, I don't know. Got a race at end of month so that's fun (if you can call 26.2 fun).

I can do $50 I've been under budget for TWO WHOLE MONTHS, haven't I earned the right to blow a measly 50 bucks on shitcoins?  
 
I don't want Litecoin though. I want the dogshit pink sheets penny cryptos. That's my style. 
 
Look at this poo poo, $50 would buy 1.3 million shitcoins of "PACcoin". That's a winner right there. $0.000038 per.

I'm good just not much to share. Feeling like a hermit. Not going out or dating or anything. Who can afford such a thing.  
First 10 days of 2018 I've spent 92 bucks, so the under $1k spending budget is on target. If I could stay way way under perhaps I should use the extra room to buy a new vacuum cleaner thing for my pool. The old one broke a couple months ago. Had an pool expert friend take it apart and it was not repairable.

Thanks! This looks like a much better option. What I was doing was attaching the hose to the dedicated vac line and dive to the bottom of the pool for a while to vacuum up the dirt and little leaves and crap using the hose. So, I don't mind the work. Also means I really don't need something. But I do. Because vacuuming an entire pool with a little hose is a bit much to sustain.

Not sure about the believer part. Interested for sure. I find it funny that most people are either 100% hate hate hate against it or 100% all-in for it. The more I look into it the more I realize I have no clue wtf is going on. I just get this feeling like there are puppet handlers up there just making things move how they want to in this crazy crypto market. And we're just down here flailing around wondering what the hell is going on. Or some think they know what's happening and are just oblivious in a glossy-eyed-lambo-wanting-world when they haven't a clue and will probably get rattled when it all comes crashing down, if they don't lose money via hacking or something else first. I kinda just wanted to throw a little bit in just to get a taste and see what it's all about but I really can't. So I'm just doing it vicariously. I have a family member and two close friends, all of which are balls-deep into crypto - albeit each of them on different financial levels. It's kinda scary. Trying to help them at least take some sensible precautions with security measures.

My current mortgage payment is $1750. It's going up. 
 
Your escrow account has a shortage of $244

Yeah, escrow accounts paid through your mortgage and managed by a bank are always doing that poo poo, and it always happens around tax time for some reason. It's a good idea to keep a bit of money on the side for when the local tax board re-assesses your home at a higher value and raises your taxes. It's only $20/mo this time, but the next time it may be quite a bit more. That happened to me three years in a row. Escrow accounts have really idiotic rules about how much more or less they can have in them and it always ends up with poo poo like this. I took over my own escrow and have an excel spreadsheet with cool formulas I made so that I can look forward and adjust how much to put into the account each month.

my credit union is offering credit card balance transfer for 0.99% for 9 months 
going to do it, then knock the remaining balance off asap
 
 
   

 
 
It's not a new line of credit. It's an existing card. It's just moving the balance from one card to the other. I don't think opening a new credit card account is a good idea. 
 
This will save me a lot more than $50. I'm paying $50 per month in drat interest charges right now.

February is auto insurance payment, it only went up about $12 since the last 6-month period so that's not bad, it always goes up. I've put aside money monthly to make it easy to fit in like an actual budgeting adult.  
 
The slow progress is a drag at times but it's the only way to dig out.
 
 
    

 
 
$4 under budget. 10 hours to go. 
 
 
I always used to buy lunch for my pre-K'er once a week on pizza day for $3 
For the past few months I stopped that and pack her lunch every day. 
Two weeks ago her teacher advised she wanted pizza the previous week. 
I spoke with daughter and reiterated why she's bringing lunch every day (well I didn't really say I have budgeting problems). 
She thought about it for a minute then proposed that I buy her pizza every other week. 
I was impressed with her negotiating skills and agreed. 
So she got pizza yesterday for $3. 
Clever girl.

I feel like I've answered this already but here goes again 
 
My organization and report presentation in this thread has been lacking I know. I'll work on that 
 
new amount - 2700 
other credit card accounts - 0 
old payments - I don't know what you are asking. I paid varying amounts each month.
 
 
  

 
 
It'll be gone long before the 9 month 0.99% period ends. 
 
My plan? Continue staying under spending budget like I have the past 3 months. Throw the rest at the card. Will be filing tax return this month, hopefully will get a refund, and throw 100% of that towards the credit card balance. 
 
An avenue I haven't driven down yet is figuring out a way to increase income.

I think I need to change the $1000 to $900.
 
 
     

 
 
Boom. SpotHero.com is refunding me after I submitted a support ticket. I reserved a parking spot and when I got there the road was closed so I couldn't use it. Opened support ticket, 4 days later they are refunding me and giving me an additional credit for next time. Good customer service! 
 
Anyway, now for January I was $13 under budget. <img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-woop.gif" title=":woop:"/>
 
 
    

 
 
Sigma I'm glad you figured that out 
I'll post more after work 
I have a big problem
 
 
    

 
 
I put $3113 USD into cryptocurrency gambling, all via credit card. I started with $250 and originally planned on just doing $250 a month over the course of 4 months for a total of a $1k gamble, but it fairly quickly turned into $3113. At one point I was up (on paper) a good %. This morning during the lowest point I dipped into the negatives. 
 
My current credit card balances are: 
card1 - $2700 @ 0.99% (for next 9 months, then changes to 13.49%. This was the balance transfer from card2) 
card1 - $600 @ 13.49% 
card2 - $2366 @ 16.49% 
 
Wish I hadn't f'd up this thread with this poop. At this point I just hope the market climbs back up in the next couple months and I can cash out half or something and fix the credit card situation.
 
 
    

 
 
Can we keep this thread open to see if I can climb out of this hole before 2019?  
 
On the agreement that if I lie about any expenses or credit card balances again, and if I don't get credit card debt to zero by 1/1/2019, gas thread and permaban me

Andy - You're probably just looking at Bitcoin. I'm in a bunch of other shitcoins. Continue hodling... well, what is the other option? Cash out now and about breakeven after fees (except what about taxes, if I cash out $3113 USD, do I owe taxes?).

Probably. In my head the risk is that it takes me a bit longer to payoff my credit card balances, which in turn makes it slower to build up emergency fund, which in turn means if I lost my job I'd be much closer to having to sell my house quick, etc. All for what? I guess for the potential of doubling up or better in the longterm, if the past predicts the future. Then use that to payoff credit cards and personal loan. BFC will say the risk is I'll lose custody of my children and be living in a cardboard box under a bridge.

I'll go for a long run on Sunday and think about the crypto advice. I can't do it now. Mixture of coins mostly in cold storage, moving to wallet, then transferring to an exchange, then selling for BTC/ETH, then sending the BTC/ETH to another exchange where I can sell for USD. It's a long process. The quickest ones would be those in MEW where I could pretty quickly send them to an exchange and sell.

I'll be paying off the 2366 balance the quickest while putting minimum on card1. 
 
My current credit card balances are: 
card1 - $2700 @ 0.99% (for next 9 months, then changes to 13.49%. This was the balance transfer from card2) 
card1 - $600 @ 13.49% 
card2 - $2366 @ 16.49% 
 
Also let's add $3133 for 2 months (Dec, Jan) @ 16.49% APR charges and include that.  
 
To reiterate, my credit card balance would be about zero within the next 2 months if i hadn't used the card for crypto, so we can just count all credit card interest payments going forward.

Zaurg, you didn’t respond to my last post so I want to reiterate: you really need a tax professional. Internet forum posts are not reliable tax information and it’s clear you’re misunderstanding what people are telling you. It’s highly likely that your crypto trading generated taxable events since you entered them via Bitcoin. the IRS sees trading a bitcoin for a shitcoin as you closing a position in bitcoin, which you will have to report and may have to pay taxes on.

ryde, Elephanthead thanks. Don't want to screw up anything related to the IRS. I keep track of everything with the crypto very closely... buys, sells, fees, buy/sell price, and coin thefts. Most decent exchanges have an export feature and you can import right into a free coin tracking service that builds a report for tax purposes. The challenge is with the decentralized exchanges like the horror that is EtherDelta. Gotta manually add those to the tracking.

TBD. 
 
One exchange went down and has been down for literally weeks, and I was dumb enough to leave some shitcoins on there. The exchange keeps releasing news updates saying they're coming back but I've pretty much written it off. Talking about about $75 with this but I really wanted those two shitcoins, I haven't messed around too much with less-than-a-penny real dogshit coins, but those were two. Actually half of one of them I got moved to my wallet before the exchange crashed.  
 
It's crazy out there... I kinda wish I hadnt gotten into this just for the time spent on it alone. So many hours.

Aw damnit. Will have to find a new running forum. SA running thread definitely one of the best. Learned a lot there.
 
 
   

 
 
Woke up this morning feeling like I should sell it all and just be happy listening to BFC like moana said. 
 
Then while drinking my coffee this morning, someone I follow who has been spot-loving-on with this crypto market (followed the predictions for past few months, all accurate) says btc headed back down another 75%. 
 
Looking at the two options and the worst case scenarios, what would I regret more; 
 
1) Sell everything now, cash out ~3500 to USD, crypto market goes back up later in 2018 to new ATHs or beyond. Miss out on the gains I originally gambled for. 
note: With the cash out I would payoff the highest interest rate credit card2 ($2366), then put the remaining $1134 on card1 to get credit card balances to $2166. There is a good chance my tax refund would take care of that, so it is likely my credit card debt would be gone within a month.  
 
2) Hodl. Crypto market goes back down 75% or early 2017 levels and stagnates there for a year. Or longer. Leaving me with $3k tied up in that mess. Struggle to knock down credit card balances for the rest of the year.  
 
 
or what if I took option 1 and the crypto market still went down and I timed the poo poo right and then later in 2018 with actual cash not credit card I could throw 1-2k back into crypto at the low levels and feel ok about letting it sit there because it's not on credit card 
 
I'm just convinced whatever option I choose will end up being the wrong one 
 
yes, we're nearing capitulation
 
 
    

 
 
yes that is true bout my dad 
he went all-in, around 40k into it 
that 40k were profits from penny stocks this past year so yeah he's a penny stock guy 
we make our own decisions  
being a penny stock guy he went straight for the lowest price shitcoins you can find and dumped 20k in immediately, which really shook me. 
 
I think right now he's around -25% and that bothers me more than the gambling I've done
 
 
    

 
 
I don't know what monero gold is or what kittehcoin is 
 
he did buy some dogecoin 
 
most of mine is in stuff like 
 
XLM, XRP, XMR, DASH, ADA, SC, FCT, VEN, NEBL, DENT, SNT, XEM, MOD, BAT, FUN, POWR 
 
then I got more crazy and dove into more unknowns (i guess they're all unknowns but these seemed riskier) like 
 
ECC, ARY, OXY, DTA, EMB, COLX, PFR, TEL 
 
that's about it. 
 
EMB actually stopped trading for a bit and is no longer on CMC. That's my true shitcoin (1.5 mil shitcoins for $20) it's Trading again on one exchange so I could dump it

When I last looked at the thread you were trying to keep within your $1000 discretionary spending limit. That was supposed to be a start for unretarding your financial decisions. The next step was to start getting you to start paying off debts faster to get you out of the massive hole you are in. Instead you go and blow $3k on a gamble. A gamble that you are apparently unaware that when the price drops this usually has a cascade effect of discovering which exchanges are ponzi schemes. Hopefully whatever shitcoins you have aren't on an exchange. 
 
Are you just making minimum payments on your high interest credit cards? Are you going to be able to pay your low interest card in time? Have you considered that if you have issues with your extra $3000 of credit card balance that this may affect refinancing?

EMB actually stopped trading for a bit and is no longer on CMC. That's my true shitcoin (1.5 mil shitcoins for $20) it's Trading again on one exchange so I could dump it

Divide $3113 up into those and there you have. Some were bought early like XLM for 6 cents. Some were bought at a stupid FOMO-fueled high time like NEBL for &gt; $40

Whatever it takes to get credit card balances to zero, around $2k. That would theoretically (it changes a lot every day) leave me with about $1k crypto which is what I originally intended on gambling in the first place.

The answer to both of these is “That’s something to talk to a suitably qualified therapist about.” I don’t claim to know your internal thoughts, but I notice how the tone of your posts shifted with the thread. When people were giving you encouragement when you were making some positive steps you quickly started sounding bored. When the well-pissing started you were the complete opposite - fully engaged with the thread, and at times it almost seemed as if you were deliberately egging people on to beat on you more.

Zaurg, you could win a million dollars in the lottery today and you would still be starting a new thread in 2019. 
 
I know you think I'm a dick, and fair enough, but please listen: 
 
Your financial problems can only be solved by a thorough and permanent change in your thinking and behavior. That is something we cannot do for you, and you cannot do by yourself. 
 
The biggest thing you can do right now is want to change. I don't see that. You want the world to adapt to the way you think and for everything to work out in a way that does not require suffering, feelings of disappointment, massive change, and sacrifice- but that's never going to happen 
 
Having money doesn't make you good with money. You are in a mental and emotional place right now where all money can do for you is make things worse. 
 
Go back to therapy. Take it deadly seriously. Your insurance will cover it to an extent; withdraw your Bitcoins and use that money to make up the difference. 
 
Please understand that, while I think you are really hosed up, that I am telling you this because I don't want to see you in pain. I don't like to see people in pain. If I did, I'd be a dominatrix and make way more money. 
 
Go back to therapy. Force yourself to change. It can be done.

To succeed, Dwight. To improve. To get better. To be a better person, to be a better dad, to have more money, to win. Sure I like to laugh and have fun and not take it seriously all the time, and troll sometimes, but that's what initiates it. There are a lot of smart people here and it can be a goldmine of information. Now if I could just stay focused and listen to it more often. And improve my sometimes very questionable methods. And stop the self-sabotaging behavior... which I was thinking about during my lunch run... I bet deep down I do that to make it more challenging? I was asking myself why I run while I ran, as many runners do, and I've done plenty of times before, and it's really the challenge. Setting a goal... working towards it, improving health, having my kids seeing me get fit, setting a good example, etc. Boss offers to take me out to lunch and I decline because I have an 8 mile tempo run to get done for marathon training, gently caress yeah, <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/safs/smilies/f/0/getin.001.gif" title=":getin:"/>. So do I regularly gently caress up with finances to make it more challenging? Like, drat I need that credit card so I have something to knock down. It sounds stupid but maybe there is something to that. 
 
I'm going to print this post out and take it with me to discuss with therapist. Maybe I can learn some new habits to stay on target more often.

anyway, i've declined. no more purchases.

Also you know the mindset of these people who get into crypto is loving nuts. Like, 100% gains are meaningless. Everyone wants 100,000% gains. Just chatting with my dad the other day who's last purchase was ETH. I suggested he just hold the ETH instead of throwing it into the garbage shitcoins (ETH is a shitcoin too, I know, I know BFC). His argument was that ETH may only double or even go up 3x, so that's not good. I think this is a fairly common thought process in this land.

Your "running total" section is helpful but structured confusingly. You have columns for "spent" and "value" from which you are calculating an <i>unrealized</i> ROI. This is fine for illustration purposes, but misleads your brain subconsciously. 
 
Column headings should be, IMO: 
Spent 
<b>Recouped</b> (give yourself a way to track progress selling!) 
Current value held (rename value to avoid ambiguity) 
<b>Realized ROI</b> (currently greater than -100% due to interest) 
Theoretical remaining ROI (renamed from ROI) 
 
Suggestions welcome from folks with more experience, but those were the obvious blind spots to me. 
 
The calculations get a bit more complicated, but you'll need that information for taxes anyway, and you really can't afford to count your chickens before they hatch <b>or</b> structure your running tally to look like money only goes in (this is your brain on hodling).

It’s deceptive for the same reason you shouldn’t put your retirement performance or your house’s value on it - you’re counting things with potential future value for something that should only regard your present situation. Sure, they’re a potential asset in the future but they can give you the wrong idea of your financial picture.  
 
It leads to thinking that you’re a paper millionaire and the reckless spending it engenders, and then when the bottom drops it leaves you in an enormous hole. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
I got you. 
I might as well remove value completely then.  
Actually, I should remove crypto from it completely. The money is already spent and it's presented in it's correct form as credit card balance. Once the credit card balance is zero, it's gone, done. Money spent. You guys wanted to see it though so that's why I put it there. Also I agreed it would be good to see what I really spent when including credit card interest.  
 
 
What about emergency fund balance? I kinda want to leave that there because I want to build it up and track progress.

Can un-spend it - agreed 
 
Scratch-offs - ok, but, I'm not sacrificing hundreds of thousands of dollars in lifetime earnings. so I don't understand the direct comparison. it's $3155. plus some more credit card interest that'll come. i don't do scratch offs/lottery. i don't gamble on sports. in the past I've gone to a casino on average every 3-4 years with $200 to play poker.  
 
In conclusion the crypto gamble is just that. A gamble. Went into it knowing it could go to zero. A lot of smarter people than I say crypto is dying and going to zero. A lot of smarter people than I are saying it's just a dip and will go back up higher than before. I have no clue. I'm not saying its money well spent. I'm not saying I'm "writing it off" as a loss. I'm just gonna let it ride as originally planned. Perhaps my logic and evaluation of risk/reward is flawed. So far BFC and the GBS Buttcoin thread which I can no longer post in hasn't been able to say anything to change my mindset on the matter. But I'll keep reading everything with an open mind.

Zaurg, here’s an example of how compound interest can help you or gently caress you 
 
I got a mortgage that was less than half of what I could “afford” according to the bank. It was a typical 30 year note. Since starting it I have paid double the required amount each period. This has resulted in me being on track to reduce the length of time I’ll be paying by TWO-THIRDS, just by doubling my payments. My house will be paid off in ten years rather than thirty. This is because the extra money I pay goes 100% into paying off principle, which prevents future interest, which prevents future interest on that interest, etc. etc. and meaning I will pay less than a quarter of what I would have if I didn’t do that.  
 
After that ten years, I will have the entirety of that doubled payment to do whatever I want with, and I won’t have to worry about losing my house.  
 
I am also putting as much money as I can into retirement, because every year it’s in there I get a little bit of interest, which will get interest on it the next year, etc etc until you have an exponential growth because you’re multiplying by a huge number. 
 
Here’s the easiest way to calculate the consequences of interest - it’s not correct, but it’s close enough: 
Take your starting amount.  
Multiply by 1 plus the interest rate (so 17% is 1.17, 4% is 1.04, 3.5 is 1.035%) - that’s the value after one interest period (a month, a year, etc) 
Keep hitting enter for however many interest periods you want... that’s what it’ll be after that amount of time 
 
This doesn’t account for payments made or additions to the principle, but it gives you an idea.  
 
The idea should be: 
* Pay off interest accruing debt <i>as fast as possible</i>, and 
* Put savings in interest accruing accounts <i>as soon as possible</i> 
 
The money in my retirement accounts has more than doubled in ten years. I’ve reduced my expected debt from my mortgage by two thirds. This is how you get rich, through care and discipline. I will almost certainly never have to worry about money for the rest of my life. I can buy whatever dumb poo poo I want (like a forums rereg) because I paid myself and my family first.  
 
If you won the bitcoin lottery tomorrow and somehow managed to withdraw it, you still wouldn’t be rich because you still don’t have the discipline to treat that windfall responsibly. It would be gone in a year or less. You are already sacrificing your future because you can’t discipline your present, and you’re making your kids pay for it. 
     </blockquote></div>
 
This is impressive. Congrats

<img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-psyduck.gif" title=":psyduck:"/> 
 
You seem to have trouble with the basic concept of looking at the possible returns from different outcomes and figuring out the expected return based on probability. Since <img alt="" border="0" src="http://fi.somethingawful.com/safs/smilies/b/4/zaurg.001.gif" title=":zaurg:"/> is already happening, this effortpost is probably going to waste, but look, this is how you figure this stuff out, ok? 
 
There's really only 3 possibilities. 
 
<b>Outcome 1:</b> Crypto value goes up to infinity, your $3113 turns into a bazillion dollars 
<b>Possible return from Outcome 1:</b> $infinity 
<b>Probability of Outcome 1:</b> Virtually zero* 
 
* in case I have to explain the maths because you said you are bad at maths: the value of something can never be infinite, it's a mathematical impossibility. So the probability of it happening has to be zero. So if something is just a little bit less than infinity, then its probability is just a little more than zero. 
 
<b>Outcome 2:</b> By some miracle, you manage to cash out your crypto position for total purchase amount plus all credit card interest charged on the purchases amounts at 17% p.a. 
<b>Possible return from Outcome 2:</b> $nil 
<b>Probability of Outcome 2:</b> Zero** 
 
** we know this is zero because YOU COULD HAVE DONE THIS LAST WEEK and guess what - YOU DIDN'T 
 
<b>Outcome 3:</b> You hold onto your crypto forever regardless of its value^. You spend the rest of your life paying the interest on that credit card because your past history shows you are unable to actually pay off the credit card debt. 
<b>Possible return from Outcome 3:</b> -$17,667. This is the present value of a $530 interest payment per year (17% p.a. rate on a $3113 balance) for the rest of your life, at an assumed annual inflation rate of 3% p.a. Note that this is a NEGATIVE NUMBER because you are going to be paying the equivalent of that much because YOU BOUGHT INTERNET FUNNY MONEY WITH A HIGH INTEREST CREDIT CARD. 
<b>Probability of Outcome 3:</b> Virtually 100%*** 
 
^ Forever. Because if you didn't cash out at breakeven and you didn't cash out when you were up 200+%, you are not gonna cash out unless you think you are in Outcome 1. Which is pretty much not gonna happen. 
*** because there's only 3 possible outcomes, their probabilities need to add up to 100%. 
 
Your expected return here is calculated like this: 
Expected return = (Probability of Outcome 1 * Possible return from Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 * Possible return from Outcome 2) + (Probability of Outcome 3 * Possible return from Outcome 3) 
= (Virtually zero * $infinity) + (Zero * $nil) + (Virtually 100% * -$17,667) 
= (a small amount, like, I dunno, say <img alt="" border="0" src="https://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/emot-10bux.gif" title=":10bux:"/>) + ($nil) + (very close to the entire -$17,667, like say -$17,510 for nice round numbers) 
= -$17,500 
 
This -$17,500 is your expected return after considering all of the possible outcomes. I repeat, this is your expected return after considering ALL OF THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. If you had a machine that let you travel to any alternate reality you wanted out of an infinite number of alternate realities, there is only ONE alternate reality in which you become richer than Bill Gates, fill your swimming pool with all the dumb fiat currency in the world, light it on fire and get your Michelin starred personal chef to use that fire to cook gourmet pizza lunch for your kids every day. 
 
Read all of my post again. Now think about this: <b>you have literally just said that <u>you prefer to lose $17,500</u> to losing $0. Because you think a virtually impossible event is going to happen.</b>

I know, right? Not everyone is as good at sniffing out scams like we are, Fleta. I looked that teacher in the eye and I just knew she was after the $ she's scraping off the top.

So, $6.00, and they double cut it, so 16 slices. $0.375 per slice. The kids probably get 2 slices. $0.75 per kid. $3.00 - $0.75 = $2.25 she is banking per kid. GTFO, Teach, my daughter can eat delicious frozen pizza from Trader Joe's ($4.00 pizza, it's actually really good, throw some broccoli on top of it too) with us for dinner once a week and she'll bring her lunch.

Say you want to bet $100 on a coin flip. You can make a probability table of outcomes.  
 
Win: 50% chance, gain of $100 
Lose: 50% chance, gain of -$100 (or 100% loss, or a net result of zero) 
 
The probabilities have to add up to 100%, and the Expected Outcome is the probability of each outcome multiplied by its result 
 
In our coin flip example, the Expected Value of the coinflip is going to be $0 because you have 0.5*$100+0.5*(-$100) 
 
So, in the multitude of universes of coin flips, you have an equal chance of getting money as losing money, so things even out.  
 
This might seem obvious, but it’s a simple example. Its real utility comes with multiple possibilities and multiple outcomes: 
 
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-expected-value-of-the-number-of-heads-obtained-when-three-fair-coins-are-tossed-simultaneously" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-e...-simultaneously</a> 
 
So with the analysis you so casually dismissed, we used past experiences to demonstrate  
 
1) You won’t sell at a gain 
2) you won’t sell at a break even or slight loss 
 
These have positive value results, but near zero probability  
 
But we need 100% probability. The first two are near zero, which means there’s an almost guaranteed (100%) chance you hold onto the coins until their value is zero 
 
0.000001*$1,000,000,000 + 0.000001*$3,000 + 0.999998*(-$17,600) means the most likely outcome is that you lose everything. The other outcomes of great wealth are overwhelmed by the vanishingly low probability they will happen.  
 
Because you’re an idiot dedicated to the dream of being rich instead of listening to people who understand this stuff telling you what to do to <i>actually</i> be rich.  
 
Divorce your wife. Stop buying stupid poo poo. Sell your overpriced crap. Pay off all your debt. Save your money, invest it in index funds, and don’t touch it.  
 
You could prove us all wrong by selling your coins <i>right now</i> - then your Expected Value will jump from a -$17k to a $0, or maybe even higher depending on what you do with the money.

This is a lot of activity that makes you feel like you’re doing something, but any payoff from it is completely out of your hands. You’re rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic instead of getting into a lifeboat or finding a life jacket.  
 
Think about how much time you’re spending to make sure you don’t lose your private keys (lol), lose your wallet file (lol), get your passwords hacked at an exchange (lol), none of which prevents the exchange going bust and stealing all your coins (LOL) or the price from cratering leaving you holding the bag.  
 
Don’t you think that time could be spent better, like with your kids, or doing a part-time job, or mowing your lawn so you don’t have to pay for lawn care?

Yes you were. You are focusing on the mechanics of exiting, but you haven't set a rule for when to exit. So yes, you are, in fact, rearranging deck chairs. Instead of going "gee, I will board a lifeboat when the ship's crew are telling me to", you are concerned with "how do I best arrange these deck chairs in order to get the best view of other people boarding the lifeboats"? 
 
Specifically, we asked you to set an exit price. <b>What is your exit price?</b> 
 
 
This is not an exit price. Why is this not an exit price? Because you have a portfolio of multiple coins. We don't even know the relative weightings of each coin in your portfolio. You do not know which ones (if any) will get to a price that is going to get your portfolio to that number. Even if you did somehow get to that number, you'll just look at your portfolio and go, welp, I got to 6k, why cash out anything at all, I should just keep holding! 
 
Set an exit price for each of these coins. If it hits that price, sell that coin. With luck, over time, you might cash out $3k. 
 
Or, you know, keep going for the -$17,500 loss that I predicted based on you paying $530 interest on your credit card for life. Whatever. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
 
I get your point. I'm looking at portfolio and fumbling around with this because I don't know what to set. For example I have 4 coins &gt; 200% right now and I don't think I should sell them. So when the hell would I? 750%? 1000%? Then I have some at NEGATIVE 40-60%. So sell the good performing ones and hang on to the ones that have poo poo the bed?

It's been obvious that this is the case since MTGOX. The real way to make money with cryptos is to: start a shitcoin pump and dump, hack poorly protected exchange computers, or more recently issue commands to wallets like the ethereum one to redirect all the coins to your wallet.

Honestly, BFC is just not the best place to deal with this stuff. People here are super risk adverse. Making 5% a year is fine and great and probably is what you should be doing most of the time. But nothing that BFC recommends will ever have the potential of cryptocurrency. All you can possibly lose if your initial investment while you stand to make 100x or 1000x more. The initial miners/investors did it. Cryptocurrency is still in the early adoption phase. 
If you lose your 3k, so what, big deal. Sure you're in the hole for a while longer but that's been the case for years anyways. Your family doesn't know the difference. But nothing BFC recommends has this sort of potential. Being down 3k changes nothing. Being up 3M changes everything. Come back as a multimillionaire and laugh at everyone.

The general rule if you're earning a normal-ish amount of money (i.e. not deep into six-figure territory) is that housing shouldn't cost more than 25% of your income, with zaurg being well past that. I went to a financial advisor a very long time ago when I lived in Vancouver and the meeting pretty much derailed immediately because my rent was over 40% of my income and there was basically no way to solve my financial insolvency without fixing that ratio. 
 </blockquote></div>

Correct. The thing with &gt;25% of your income going into housing generally means even if you're "solvent" on paper, you're probably not putting enough money (if any) into things like savings and retirement, so when something goes wrong financially (like $3113 going on your credit card), you're in trouble. 
 
 
Pretty sure it's based off net income and includes all direct housing expenses (so rent/mortgage, insurance, HOA fees and property taxes) but doesn't include utilities, it's meant to be a rough guideline. So if you were renting you would ideally want your ceiling to be $1200/month ($10 over the 25% threshold). You can bend it to a certain degree but the more you go over the riskier it gets, and in your case since you're terrible with money you probably want to lean on the 25% as much as possible so your bad decisions aren't as catastrophic. 
    </blockquote></div>
 
ok so is this correct: 
 
net income 4622 (gross income, minus taxes and health insurance) 
mortgage 1766

Ah yes. Yes I am considering it. Why is it a terrible suggestion?  
 
house sale 350k 
- 248k mortgage payoff 
- 25k seller fees (~7%) 
- 5k personal loan payoff 
- 3k credit card payoff 
= 69k 
 
Assuming a 350k sale is doable, 69k in the bank and 100% debt free. A 330k sale would mean 51k banked.

Zaurg, do I understand correctly that you stopped dating and canceled all of your entertainment subscriptions to save money shortly before you started gambling on crypto? 
 
Like was there a period of a few days or maybe even weeks during which you felt terribly bored and then sought out crypto as a form of entertainment? 
 
I wonder if you might benefit from looking for a hobby/club or just keeping a Netflix account or something. It sounds like you're dealing with the financial equivalent of bulimia. Like maybe don't go full hairshirt and waste all your self control at once.

Yes that is correct. Broke up with gf in mid October. Crypto in early November. I do still have Google Music and Netflix, and found a show this week I like for the first time since Ozark, so that's cool, good to find some entertainment indeed. 
 
I didn't think I sought out crypto as a form of entertainment but maybe you're right.

nah man. Actually thank you for the link, I hadn't heard the recent news about EMB. I saw some announcements on Telegram and angry responses but with only $20 into it I haven't cared much. I had it marked as zero because the exchange I got the shitcoins on has been "down" since the first week of January.

<li>You job Direct Deposits your paycheck into your bank account. You then

<li>set aside a portion of the remaining money for that month's portion of yearly expenses. 1/12 of estimated property taxes, homeowner's insurance, plus any billing that's on 3 or 6 month payment cycles like car insurance or whatever. Then you can 
<li>set aside a portion for your emergency savings (if that has been drawn down because you had an unexpected emergency expense like your car breaking down) and retirement, Roth IRA, and what you want to put into general savings, etc. <i>Then</i> and only then you can

 </li> </li> </li> </li> </li></ol>
 
If you run out of money before you get to the envelopes, that means your budget is out of whack and you need to reconfigure. Reduce static expenses, increase income, or something else dramatic.

No problems with Coinbase aside from they've blocked me from buying - which is fine by me.

Also after my dad deposited a couple thousand USD 2 weeks ago they blocked access to his account and he can't get to the USD to withdraw it or buy bitcoin with it. Pretty hosed up all around by Coinbase lately.

- cancel google music, use free streaming 
- refinance. contact local mortgage broker and get new quotes to refi from current 30yr 4.5% 
- sell house, downsize to smaller house 
- pay $50 to use YNAB. tried the free version, was too much for me. 
- cut my own hair instead of monthly $22 haircuts 
- get new homeowner's insurance quote to lower cost from current $2800/year 
- cancel gym membership, find a free used treadmill 
- set SMART goals

Great question 
 
1) I want the comfort and security of having 3 months worth of 100% of my expenses stored away in an emergency fund. 
 
2) I want to have regular savings built up to have the ability to take my kids on a nice vacation once per year, and to have other little vacations with them once in a while, go do fun stuff, sometimes free, sometimes expensive. Just have that capability without using a credit card and without draining any little savings I have. 
 
3) I'd like to have some car security like to be able to budget/save enough to afford to buy a decent car. I'm still driving a 2002 beater and I don't know how much life it has left.  
 
That's about it. Retirement account ok but doesn't really motivate me, I guess it should. College, meh. They can pay for it.  
 
The key to these is increasing income, getting rid of debt, then building up savings way up. 3 months emergency fund would be 12k. Nice sized savings 6k. Then I could go on a up to 1k vacation and spend 1k on clothes for me and kids, buy nice clothes for once, then replenish the 2k throughout the year. I literally have two pair of pants that fit me and one pair of shorts. Car I don't know, not sure how that's even possible. I'll probably just buy used again, but even with that I need to build up a car fund account.

Check what your insurance provider covers if you want them to pay for any treatment, though how much you pay will depend on your policy. 
 
A psychiatrist has an M.D. and can prescribe medication. A psychologist has a Ph.D. in how the mind works.

I've added to the goals as well which is to be able to afford to pay for my kids extracurricular activities. My oldest is into a sport that involves two multiple night out of town trips per year, one of them out of state, they will be doing fundraisers but it's still pretty expensive.  
 
My youngest is obsessed with horses and would love to send her to a horse riding camp in a year or too when a bit older, if she's still into that. And she might want to get into gymnastics. 
 
 
Yes 
 
Strategy is to continue the good work I've made on not wasting money on restaurants, keep the monthly discretionary expenses down further under budget, allowing me to get the credit cards to zero quicker with the help of tax refund, focus on building the emergency fund faster than $250/month, evaluate how fast I should pay off the remaining balance on the 5% loan, and make a profit on the crypto. 
 
I'm very confident the strategy will work. Of course I can't control major unexpected setbacks along the way since I effectively have zero emergency fund. 
 
Where I lack confidence is my longterm capability to follow the plan.

somewhere around 100k.

Let me answer this again. If you remove my house and 401k, my net worth is NEGATIVE $6022. I think that's a more important number to realize. 
 
Another fact that is crazy is that I'm 40 and have contributed to a 401k with my employers matching a % for 11 years total, and the entirety of my retirement savings is at $20k right now in the 401k. I literally am my dad, using my retirement savings for other poo poo besides retirement.
 
 
   

 
 
income	$4,370.00 per month. This is after taxes, health ins, and 401k. 
 
regular monthly bills	$2,570.00 per month. This is everything fixed and/or automatic. Including $100 minimum payment towards personal loan with $5460 remaining balance. 
 
annual expense fund	$125.00 per month. This is regular annual expenses like auto ins.  
 
emergency fund building	$250.00 per month 
 
$1,425.00 left for food, medical, clothes, kids extracurricular, car related expenses, paying off credit card debt, extra emergency fund contribution, and bullshit. 
 
 
gently caress. Unless I'm missing something, I should be able to do ok with that and not be broke as hell.

If my tax refund calculates as I think it will, my total credit card debt should be a little under $1500 by March 1st.  
1500 credit card 0.99% interest until Sept, in Sept it jumps to 13.9%. 
5460 personal loan 5% interest, 100 min payments 
I think I'll focus on that credit card 1500 first. 
Once that is gone, ramp up the emergency fund building and at least double my personal loan payments, if not more.  
 
If we ignore the shitcoins for the moment, how does that plan sound?

that's not directly applicable since you have two different properties that are valued differently (your bch is worth 33% more) and so it's not as simple as dividing up your cost basis. 
 
I recommend getting a hold of a CPA, it's probably either that your cost basis is halved for both the BTC and BCH and thus you owe nothing, or the fork was an income event of BCH and you owe tax on the BCH for the spot price of BTC at the time of the fork.

Can you guys at least help me set a sell target price for the shitcoins? I mean I let the poo poo go up around 200% before and didn't sell. You guys continue to scream about selling but it's only at around 20% now. I know you're saying do it now, but just pretend your a buttcoin lover for a day, or any of you that actually do hold some coins, what's a good plan here? The only part I'm considering is to NOT just "hodl" until the end of the year, and maybe sell half of them before then on a little spike like we're seeing now.

The ones that are up 200% or more have already realized their potential and are due to correct downwards. Sell them.

I think you post here just because you like the attention , but I can’t fathom the math on saying you have contributed with match (of any kind) for 11 years and your 401k is only at $20k.  
 
Like, how is that possible? Between way, 6%, and 50-100% March, and 2009-2018 being an almost constant uptick in stocks, I just don’t understand. Math wise if you make $4300 after tax, benefits, etc, then you must make at least $70k. That’s $4200 a year with 6% contribution, so $6k to $8k depending on match. So multiple that by 11 years, AND factor in stocks going up, and I can’t fathom only having $20k in.  
 
Like, did you cash it all out early?  
 
Otherwise, I call bullshit on 401k contributing. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
70k is recent 
 
Used to make half that 
 
Did not contribute for a few years between 2009-2013? not sure exactly when current employer started 401k. and they started matching in 2017. 
 
anyway it's true, sorry for the sketchy details.  
 
I took out some in 2008? or 2009 i forget, but at least 10k taken out. Then during divorce used the entire IRA to get that done, and was only able to keep my 401k which has gone from around 5k to 20k in the past two years.

All right, I took a stab at making a TOXX earlier in this thread on page 22, but it wasn't thought out well and it wasn't enough of a challenge. 
 
How about this for TOXX? Specific short-term goals. Measurable. Achievable (I think so, BFC may not). Relevant. Time-bound to the day. 
 
By 1/1/2019: 
1) Emergency fund: Balance $5000 or higher. Current balance as of 2/20/18 is $1875. 
2) Credit card: Zero balance. Current combined balances on all cards is $5776. 
3) Personal loan: Paid off completely. Zero balance. Current balance is $5460. 
NOTE: Cannot take on any new debt to accomplish the 3 goals above.

The TOXX qualifies as a SMART goal, MZT, does it not? 
 
As with all goals, there are multiple mini goals involved to reach the end goal. It could be broken down by day, by week, by month - goals involved with all of them.  
 
 
These should be added to TOXX - Rules: 
Continued 5% or higher 401k contributions required each pay period. 
No new debt allowed. 
No emergency fund scraping to pay off credit cards or personal loan allowed. 
No cashing out 401k.

Beanie babies have more value underpinning them than shitcoins - at the very least you have a cuddly toy 
People compare cryptocurrency to beanie babies or pogs or whatever because their price is almost entirely speculative i.e. it's based on the expectation that you'll be able to sell it on to someone else who in turn will sell it on to someone else. This is a problem because a combination of hype and scarcity can drive prices to truly stupid levels, and because as soon as new money stops entering the system and you run out of greater fools to pass the bag to the whole thing starts to collapse. 
You should be trying to find someone dumber than you and offloading your shitcoins on to them ASAP so that they carry the risk.

I haven't made the comparison but I think it's pretty good. Beanie Babies are pretty inexpensive to make and not that fun to play with, so in theory it should be easy for toy makers to make equivalent, cheaper toys. There was a period when people bought Beanie Babies just to sell to other people who collected Beanie Babies, which drove up the price. Their value has since dropped a lot, so people who bought Beanie Babies to resell them lost money. 
We don't expect non-speculative stuff to suddenly experience a drop in price like this because it's still worth something if you can't resell it. People in this thread have been using phrases like "actual value" to refer to what something would be worth if you could only resell it to someone who was going to use it, not resell it. 
Most people who buy cryptocurrency just want to sell it back when the price rises and they expect the price to continue to rise because it did in the past. But cryptocurrencies are kind of useless for anything other than selling back when the value increases (because of lack of markets that accept them, constant fluctuation in value, high transaction fees) so most goons think cryptocurrencies cost much more than their actual value. If that's true, you should expect them to drop in price after fear sets in and causes a bunch of adopters to sell for closer to actual value, but we don't know when this will happen.  
It will probably happen when there aren't enough buyers for most cryptocurrency sellers to actually sell back at higher than the price they paid, but that could take a long time to happen because it could take a long time for prospective sellers to realize this -- especially since a lot of people say they won't even try to sell until cryptocurrency is valued at way more than it is now.

I've altered the bubble chart to include common bitcoin talk to clarify what it means. 
Because it's a bubble, we don't know where we are or whether you can make additional money by holding. I've annotated the three places in the chart that we're likely to be at with ?. We're probably not in the blowoff phase, but every time there's a selloff, it's possible that the resale price will drop below the actual value. 
 
<img alt="" border="0" class="timg" src="https://i.imgur.com/DhRQv2B.png"/> 
 
Put super short, items that are priced closed to their actual value don't experience a big selloff every time the resale price drops, and the price doesn't drop by huge extents every time a selloff occurs. We can't know which selloff is going to be the last one, except in hindsight. We know that if you miss the last selloff though, you probably lose most of your money. 
(EDIT: Some talk is missing here: namely, bubbles get worse when the government funds investment during the awareness phase, and price drops below actual value because people produce too many of asset X when the price is at its peak. But those things don't really apply to bitcoins.)

Good answers thank you.  
 
Dogwood, I don't know man. There may end up being none. I've never actually purchased anything with crypto aside from more crypto. I know stuff *has* been purchased, and there are online retailers who accept crypto payments (bitcoin and altcoins) but my thinking about it was they're mostly just test cases and the true believers trying to push adoption. That one headphones site accepts crypto and the CEO has posted some interesting thoughts about the experience. I see people "tipping" crypto on reddit which seems pretty cool/convenient. But again those are all just "crypto people" aka a small section of "ugly, greasy retards" as Chadzok eloquently put it.

Even though basically every shitcoin is still way more valuable than it was in November he bought the majority of his cryptos at the peak or after the peak of the market In late December/January. He's got a small number of ridiculous profits due to the timing of the initial $500 offsetting the retarded way he spent the last $2,600.  
 
For example Lumens, he said he had 1,300% profit on them at one point and didn't sell for whatever reason. He bought them in November and they are still worth 5-10x what he paid for them, but if he had bought them in late December or January like the majority of his cryptos then he would have lost 50%-75% on them.  
 
Of course even pointing this out to someone like Zaurg is dangerous because they don't go "Hey I'm extremely lucky because of the fortunate timing of my earlier gambles covering my losses by complete accident" and instead he thinks "This means I should go all in next time and follow my instincts because If I had put in $3,100 in November <img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-words.gif" title=":words:"/><img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-words.gif" title=":words:"/>"

VQLit, at one point I was up 2500% in SC. And I didn't sell. The reason is because when I bought all this poo poo I went into it with the intention of "well I'll just hodl everything for a year and see what happens" - aka not a real goal, not a real exit strategy.

My top concern at this point is my dad. He's put 40k into crypto, mostly near the peak, and wants to buy the dip today "because this is as low as it'll probably go". He also has put $ into mining already and is in the process of trying to configure some kind of trading bot. He wants my help with all this but I don't want to encourage him because I'm pretty uneasy with the riskiness of it all - 1k was my original gamble plan and I stretched to 3k. And he's going mountains above that, foot on the pedal without slowing down. Being on SA gives me a good close look of the what intelligent people who are against crypto are saying instead of constantly being in a bubble of crypto-enthusiasts in chat rooms/forums/facebook/reddit/twitter/pro-crypto web sites writing hilariously biased articles all day. If it wasn't for SA, there is probably a good chance I'd have put more than 3k into it.

How hosed am I for retiring? I can't find a good calculator to evaluate outcomes if I were to increase the current 5% contribution. What's a good one you guys use? I want to increase I just need to figure out the max I can do. 
 
stats: I currently contribute 5% of my salary to 401k which is about $305 per month. Employer matches 2%. Current balance is $20,000. I'm 40 years old. 
 
 
also 100% of my 401k contributions currently go to a "moderate model". I thought I had it in the "aggressive model", but evidently not. I just did the set it and forget it type thing. Is there any reason I shouldn't just put 100% of it into a S&amp;P; 500 index? What do most people do with their 401k portfolio? 
 
The MODERATE MODEL seeks the highest total investment return consistent with prudent risk. The model attempts to achieve this objective by investing:  
1% in the GM BlackRock Ready Assets Govt Liq Fund  
8% in the GM Pioneer Strategic Income R B 
19% in the GM Lord Abbett Short Duration Income R2  
3% in the GM Templeton Global Bond R  
6% in the GM BlackRock Global Allocation R  
10% in the GM ClearBridge Large Cap Growth R  
12% in the GM MFS Value R2 B 
3% in the GM iShares S&amp;P; 500 Index A  
7% in the (CL) GM JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund R2 B 
5% in the (CL) GM Janus Henderson Enterprise R  
2% in the GM Janus Henderson Triton R  
4% in the GM Victory Sycamore Small Comp Opport R B 
4% in the GM American Funds New World R2 B 
11% in the GM Janus Henderson Intl Opportunities R  
5% in the GM Calamos Market Neutral Income A  
 
Yes I expect jokes about me being in a "prudent risk" portfolio.

Pretty much this, zaurg. You are way behind the eight ball. Luckily you’re not hopeless, but you’ve wasted the best time to put in easy money and you’re currently wasting your prime earning years.  
 
Basically, you’re 50-66% hosed right now, but that at least is better than 100% hosed.  
 
General advice is: 
 
<ol class="bbc-list" type="1"><li>Get 100% of company match (free money!), whatever it might be (401(k) or otherwise), preferably in the lowest-fee index fund available, then 
<li>max out Roth contributions for the year, I think it’s $1,500, then 
<li>15-20% (include #1 in this total) into an IRA or Roth IRA, again into the lowest fee index fund, something like Vanguard is usually a good option 
</li></li></li></ol>
 
2 and 3 are sometimes swapped depending on circumstances. Pre- or Post-tax contribution will depend on your retirement plans, but if you’re not sure it’s better to contribute <i>something</i> than not have the optimal setup.  
 
And then just wait. Periodically rebalance things if you want, but only about once a year. Gradually change your balance from most aggressive (foreign and national stocks) to least aggressive (bonds) as you get close to retirement and can tolerate less risk.  
    </blockquote></div>

1) 100% of company match = This is done and has been done since it became available in January 2017. 
 
2) lowest-fee index fund = As posted above, I'm currently in the "moderate model" which is a mixture of 15 stock and bond funds. I'm looking at making this one the fund I use instead of the "moderate model", what do you think?

4) 15-20% (include #1 in this total) into an IRA or Roth IRA = so that means a total of between 15-20% of my income into retirement savings? aka combine my 401k and IRA together to equal 15-20%? 
 
 
And thank you for the math. I guess that is better than using one of the online calculators, which is limited to the interface they provide. 
 
NOTE: I've actually contributed to my 401k during every pay period possible during the past 16 years, 11 years of those having employment with 401k eligibility. 7 years of that having a % of employer matching. The reason I only have 20k is (1) I've only ever put contributed a small amount ranging between 3-6%. (2) I've withdrawn a lot of it over the years, the main bulk being done when I got divorced, to payoff ex instead of selling my house. That was a dumb decision for sure. I could've kept my IRA, sold the house, split the profits w/ ex, and made out much better.

As far as the existing 20k balance, I'm leaving it as-is. I'm not familiar with how to move it all over to the S&amp;P500; index fund, or what kind of fees are involved with that, so I think I'm better off just leaving that as-is for now and go with the BSPAX going forward.

Yeah, what are a few percentage points of long-term growth here and there, anyway? Unrelated question: how much time in total have you spent researching crypto? 
 </blockquote></div>
 
Point taken. I'll find out how expensive it is to convert the 20k balance currently mixed in bonds/cash/stocks all to the cheaper and long-term better performing S&amp;P500; index fund. 
 
Unrelated question... hard to say. And what defines "researching"? If you include *everything* like chatting, reading articles, web sites, forums, whitepapers, watching videos, learning how to use the wallets, helping other people, creating spreadsheets, etc. Man.. probably a handful of hours per week for a 14 week period. 5x14 = 70 hours? Let's just say somewhere in a range of 50-75 hours.
 
 
   

 
 
If I'm already maxing out my employer's 401k match (they contribute 2% of my salary), increasing my total retirement savings can be done via my 401k or IRA right. I mean there's no extra benefit to continue increasing the 401k rate? I suppose people just consider this when they're able to max out the limits? Which I'm not going to get close to anytime soon.

Two points on the recent retirement discussion: 
 
1) IRA contribution limit is $5,500/year, not $1,500 as has been previously stated 
 
2) While the thread’s subject is behind for retirement planning, I’m not sure I would put all future contributions into an S&amp;P; index at that age, and I definitely wouldn’t move all existing balances in the moderate fund over. That moderate fund is going to provide stability to someone we know well is an irrational actor. My recommendation is keep the existing balances and fund 75% S&amp;P;/25% moderate from here.

Roth 401k: $18000 per year limit or $1500 per month. Nowhere near the limit. I'm currently contributing 6% of salary. $4380 per year or $365 per month, plus employer's 2% match $1460 per year. Combined $5840 per year or 8% of my salary. 
 
Roth IRA: $5500 per year limit or $458 per month. I don't have this account yet. Planning on opening one in April with $500 with Wealthfront. $5110 per year or $425 per month would be required to bump my total retirement savings to 15% of my current salary. 8% into the 401k, 7% into the IRA.  
 
Per this calculator and 7% return I still wouldn't even hit a million. drat.

Your potential yield at retirement is $797,963.16

Roth 401k was updated to 6% yesterday 
 
Roth 401k has been updated to 75% into BSPAX, 25% into Moderate Model. Thank you, that makes sense. 
 
Goal: Open IRA in April with initial $500. Start by contributing 1% of my salary or about $60 per month in May, bringing my total retirement savings to 9% of salary. Then when my emergency fund is adequately funded, increase the IRA rate.

Holy poo poo. I didn't even notice my paycheck went UP by $74 on the January 31st pay period. Less taxes coming out. Updating budget.
 
 
  

 
 
Problem with TOXX. I said get emergency fund to minimum of $5000 by 1/1/19. So I'm calculating what I need to put in each month. BUT...... that doesn't factor in if I have to use any of it for emergencies. This is going to be tough. 
 
I'll figure it out. Need a surplus.

This is going to be very difficult.  
It would require staying under a monthly spending budget of $904, reduced from $1000 (which I haven't hit yet) for the next 10 months. And then when I start $60 IRA per month in April, the spending budget would reduce to $844. 
It would require not having more than $450 in emergency fund usage for the next 10 months.

Emailed my insurance agent to see if homeowners insurance can be lowered, either current policy trimmed, or find a new provider. Currently I pay $2800 per year. It's escrowed into mortgage so even lowering the plan now may not produce immediate savings, not sure how that would work, if I would get a refund check, or it would just take effect next year during escrow review if it's way off.

QuarkJets well well well now that's an interesting point  
 
Let's do some math 
 
Can you tell me how selling my shitcoins right now for $3001 will fix my retirement saving problem? 
 
I have no idea how much I want/need to have when I retire. 
 
BFC will dismiss any move made as a negative, until I sell the shitcoins. Dig those heels in, team.
 
 
    

 
 
Thanks Quark. Yes employer offers traditional 401k. The majority thought here seems to be to switch from Roth to Traditional. I don't really understand it. It's either pay tax now, or pay tax in 25 years, right? So it's better to pay whatever the tax rate will be in 25 years? Actually probably more like 30 years if I'm so lucky. 
 
If I can contribute $5500 per year and earn 7%, I should be able to save $700k, before taxes, right Quark?

The difference is pay tax now or when you retire, but at this rate you will definitely be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, so it would be better to pay tax when you retire. That means going with the Traditional plan. But this is irrelevant compared to the bigger issue of not saving nearly enough for retirement 
 
I'm not sure where you're getting $700k:

So long as you actually save the money.... 
 
 
Correct. 
 
 
Given your age, saving velocity, and current income, your effective tax rate will likely be lower even if they raise taxes. You're looking at relatively low income in retirement. 
 
 
Well first of all, 7% real is not a given. That's what its been historically, but that's just a guess based on previous performance. There's a lot of firms that are expecting closer to 4% going forward, due to current valuations. 
 
But lets use that as an estimate. If you're at $700k, then your safe withdrawal rate is between 3-4% depending on your views on future market performance. That's $21000 to $28000 per year.  
 
But I think the real reason to have the traditional 401k is that, assuming you save the exact same amount per-month towards retirement, you'll have a bit more take home pay. 
  </blockquote></div>
 
Thanks. I made the switch today to Traditional. Effective 3/1. Not sure about the 20k balance that's in the Roth right now though, I think it'll just sit there. Could it be "rolled over" somehow to the new 401k? I've already paid tax on the $ contributed to the Roth though of course so I have no idea how that would work.

This is an example of what I mentioned before. You seem to see every financial mistake as an outlier rather than recognizing a deeply-seated pattern. It makes you see financial problems as temporary setbacks, and that you'll just avoid making mistakes and get everything back on track. You have bad financial and spending habits, and they don't go away with just willpower. It will require a lot of deliberate effort and strategy (i.e. assuming you are going to gently caress up so make it harder for you to do so, or mitigate the impact). 
 
 
My provider had extra stats that indicated specialties. I specifically looked for someone with CBT and anger management experience. You might look for CBT and gambling addiction or something like that. I looked for someone with a PHd specifically because I don't trust the efficacy of a therapist without the theoretical background.

You're spot on with that. I do see them as temporary setbacks that I can overcome with will power and spreadsheets/information/tweaks here and there. I'll acknowledge that I do seem to have a lot of temporary setbacks.

I just changed my # of allowances from 3 to 10. I checked two calculators and they say that's a smart move as far as getting more take home income and less of a refund.
